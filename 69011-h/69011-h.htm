<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>The Stories in this little book have been set down almost in the same words in which
they were told. How the telling of them came about is a very simple matter. Having
three children, each of whom loved a Fairy Tale, it somehow became the fashion, on
Sunday evenings, to tell them a story.</i>
</p>
<p><i>On one occasion, when the youngest member was just about to be taken to bed, his sister
said; “None of the books about Fairies ever say a word about Australia! Are there
any Australian Fairies, Father?”</i>
</p>
<p><i>Somewhat hastily, perhaps, I answered: “Why, yes, of course! Whole tribes of them!”</i>
</p>
<p><i>Instantly the order went forth: “Then you will please tell us about them the very
next time you tell us a story!”</i>

<h2 class="main">FOREWORD.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">By the RT. HON.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;M. HUGHES, P.C., M.P.
</p>
<p>Formerly Prime Minister of Australia.
</p>
<p>War and Science between them have played havoc with the old order. Ancient landmarks
have been swept away; cherished superstitions exposed. The World has changed, but
man remains the same. His faith in Kings may have gone, but his belief in Fairies
remains. In childhood, he lives to-day as he has lived throughout the ages, in a world
which knows not change, and where the cold, hard light of science can never penetrate.
A wonderful world, inhabited by glorious beings with shimmering wings and glittering
diadems and wands; to whom nothing is impossible; for whom neither time nor space
exist, save at their will.
</p>
<p>“Where is this wonderful world?” sneers Mr. Gradgrind; “I cannot see it—it does not
exist!” No, not for you, my dear Sir! You are one of those who are not privileged
to pass its magic portals. But it is a very real world for all that. It may indeed
turn out to be no less real than this, which is the only one you deem worth knowing,
and which it is very obvious you do not know at all.
</p>
<p>It is the world in which the children of all the world live: the world of Bogies and
Dragons, Fairy Princes and Princesses, Giants and Giant Killers. It is the world we
knew so well when we, too, walked with fearful joy amid its mystic, thrilling groves.
To dull and prosaic souls it does not exist, for, lacking imagination, they walk in
outer darkness. Those fairy forms—so real to the vivid mind—are to them but the shadows
of trees in the flickering light of the moon.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb7">[<a href="#pb7">7</a>]</span></p>
<p>Hitherto, the Fairies we have known, though very delightful beings, have had their
habitat in far-off lands. Thanks to the researches of Mr. Hume Cook, we are now able
to wander through the enchanted Bush with real Australian Fairy Princes and Princesses;
share in the thrills of their amazing adventures; rejoice in the triumph of virtue;
and be glad at the downfall of vice.
</p>
<p>The dwellers in Australian Fairy Land, although akin to those of other climes, have
a distinct character of their own. Even the wicked Desert Fairies endear themselves
to us. Although they do not vomit fire, as did the dreadful dragon of our childhood,
one feels that, given a sporting chance, they would make that boastful beast curl
up like a salted worm.
</p>
<p>As for the other Fairies, everybody will love them. The stories are well told, and
the book is beautifully illustrated. Mr. Hume Cook’s book is, in very truth, a really
and truly Fairy Story Book, which Australian children of all ages will read with avid
interest and take to their hearts.

<p class="center large">“BIDGYBAH,” “POLLYKIM,” and “PINKLES.”

</p>
<p class="center large">Descriptive Characteristics of the Audience:
</p>
<p>“<span class="sc">Bidgybah</span>”: Schoolboy; full of strange noises and a scornful contempt for all things sisterly
and feminine; but with such an unquenchable thirst for stories as to be able to keep
silence whilst one is being told, and to forget for the nonce to pull his sister’s
hair, pinch her arm, or otherwise constitute himself a source of annoyance.
</p>
<p>“<span class="sc">Pollykim</span>”: Schoolgirl; demure of manner, yet overflowing with the ability to pointedly disregard
all that a boy holds in esteem; but so hungry for fairy tales as to forget her airs
for the time being, to sit still during the telling of the tale, and to refrain from
giving other offence.
</p>
<p>“<span class="sc">Pinkles</span>”: Chubby male person, aged five, with fair flaxen curls, <span class="pageNum" id="pb10">[<a href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>and a complexion remarkable for the fact that pink carnations seem to be forever chasing
white piccotees up over his cheeks into the starry depths of his grey-blue eyes. In
addition, he possesses an immeasurable love of stories about Fairies; and a red-gum
faith of so sound a quality, that the white ants of doubt and disbelief have hitherto
attacked it in vain!
</p>
<p class="center large">Origins of the Names
</p>
<p>“<span class="sc">Bidgybah</span>”: Title assumed by the present owner. Supposed to have at one time belonged to an
aboriginal Chief of extraordinary bravery and skill. Real name, Keith.
</p>
<p>“<span class="sc">Pollykim</span>”: Pet name; origin shrouded in mystery. Believed to have arisen out of an attempt
to pronounce a word too difficult for a childish tongue to overcome. Real name, Madge.
</p>
<p>“<span class="sc">Pinkles</span>”: Descriptive appellation; bestowed at a very early age consequent upon a pink and
white complexion of more than ordinary beauty. Real name, Kevyn.

<h2 class="main">THE MAGIC WELL</h2>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>In the centre of Australia there’s a large and lovely lake,</i>
</p>
<p class="line"><i>And its waters gleaming golden, from the sun their glory take;</i>
</p>
<p class="line"><i>In the middle of the waters there’s an Island, wondrous fair,</i>
</p>
<p class="line"><i>And the perfume of its fruit and flowers, like incense fills the air!</i>
</p>
<p class="line"><i>In the heart of this fair Island there’s a wonder-working well,</i>
</p>
<p class="line"><i>By the fairy-folk enchanted; for ’tis there the Fairies dwell!</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Most people seem to think that the heart of Australia is nothing but a sandy desert.
Well, that’s not quite correct. As a matter of fact, though not a great number know
it, the very, <i>very</i> centre is inhabited by Fairies. They live there on a beautiful island in the middle
of a great lake; and all they have, including their wonderful city, is all due to
the “Magic Well”!
</p>
<p>On their splendid Island there are hills covered with trees—forest trees! And there
are great valleys where wild-flowers grow; and springs and streams and waterfalls;
and caves with stalactites in them; those funny things that look something like sheep’s
tails frozen! These stalactites hang down from the cave-roofs, and even they are due
to the Magic Well! That may seem strange; but the way it happens is this:—Little drops
of water, very slowly oozing down from the top of the cave, carry with them the tiniest
bits of sand or limestone. The first pieces of sand or limestone just stick to the
roof; and then, every other little piece, after it gets through, just clings to the
piece that got there before it, so that, by-and-by, thousands and thousands of them,
all joined together, make a stalactite.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span></p>
<p>But of course there are many other things there beside those that hang in caves! For
instance, there are the loveliest birds and butterflies; the most beautiful beetles
and moths; and, above all, the rarest lot of Australian animals the eye could wish
to see. Kangaroos, Wallabys and Woolly Bears! ’Possums, Platypuses, and gaily-coloured
Lizards, big and little!… And then, the fern gullies! Why, there never were such ferns
anywhere ever before! Thousands of them! Tree-ferns galore! Stag-ferns in plenty!
Maiden-hair in bunches as large as rose bushes; larger indeed; and cat-heads; besides
great trailing asparagus ferns, and every kind that the world knows! Date palms, too;
and lofty cocoanut trees; with the cocoanuts on them always ready to pull; and banana
trees, with great yellow bunches of bananas hanging down most temptingly!
</p>
<p>Then there are bread-fruit trees, as well as fruit trees of every other description;
and flowers, and flowering shrubs in untold number and variety. Can you imagine such
a place? And all due to the Magic Well! For without that Well the Island could not
have come into existence; and, if anything were to happen to it, the Lake would disappear,
and the Fairies of Australia have to find a new home!
</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, it should have been said that the “superior fairies” would have
to find a new home, for, as everybody knows, not all the fairies live in one place.
Even those who belong to “Fairy Island” are not <i>always</i> there! Over and over again they are sent travelling about on errands for their King
and Queen; and sometimes they are given very important work to do. For example, they
are constantly showing the rain-drops just exactly where to fall; coaxing the wind
to blow more softly on the delicate flowers; pulling the dark clouds away so that
the sun can steadily shine upon the Earth, warming the soil, causing things to grow—and
making everything very sweet and pleasant for everybody!
</p>
<div class="figure p015width"><img src="images/p015.png" alt="A FOREST FAIRY." width="380" height="658"><p class="figureHead">A FOREST FAIRY.</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>Of course there are other tribes, such as the Mountain Fairies, the River Fairies,
the Forest Fairies, and many more. But these are all subject to King Waratah at Fairy
Island, and have only a Governor over them now. That was not always the case. Many
years ago the various tribes were all independent of one another, and each tribe had
its own particular piece of country within which it lived and was <span class="pageNum" id="pb17">[<a href="#pb17">17</a>]</span>supreme; and, naturally, each had its own King or Queen! But a time arrived when this
was changed; and it came about in quite a wonderful way, and, in a manner of speaking,
all through the Magic Well! Some day you shall be told all about it; but, for the
moment, attention must be devoted to the discovery of the Magic Well, and what took
place as the result of that happy event.
</p>
<p>Now this is how the Well came to be found.
</p>
<p>Prince Waratah, as he was then called, having come of age, was sent by his father
to look for a wife. It was then the custom among the fairies—as it still is among
the crowned heads of the world—for the King’s sons and daughters to get their wives
or husbands from among the families of other Royal households. The Prince’s father—who
was the head of the Forest Fairies—was called King Eucalyptus! And a very clever and
prudent old King he was, too; though not nearly so wise as his son became, as you
shall learn later on! At the same time he was not without a great deal of what is
termed “natural shrewdness”! He therefore reasoned that, if he sent his son travelling
from tribe to tribe—with strict injunctions or orders not to choose a wife until he
had seen at least six Princesses—he must indeed learn many things that were unknown
to his father. So off the Prince went!
</p>
<p>As it chanced, however, his father need not have had any anxiety about his making
any mistake in selecting a wife; for he had very good taste, and was gifted with what
is called discrimination, or the power to see for himself the best in whatever came
under his notice. So, though he paid many visits to many Fairy Kings, up to this time
he was by no means satisfied to make a choice. His latest journey had taken him to
stay for a while with a tribe of Fairies who lived in what is now called the “Northern
Territory”—quite close to the Gulf of Carpentaria.
</p>
<p>The King of those Fairies had several daughters, all very bright and witty in their
conversation, but, possibly owing to the heat of the climate, rather sallow complexions,
and not nearly beautiful enough to please the Prince’s fancy. He, therefore, finally
resolved to make his way across the Continent from North to South; for, so he had
heard, the Wattle Fairies of that part of Australia that <span class="pageNum" id="pb18">[<a href="#pb18">18</a>]</span>is now known as Victoria, were particularly fair and lovely, and he cherished the
hope that at long last he would discover a Princess fit to be his wife.
</p>
<p>As may be imagined, in the course of such an extraordinary lengthy journey—about two
thousand miles—he naturally met with quite a number of adventures. Of these there
is not time to tell; except to say, that though over and over again in peril from
the wicked Desert Fairies, who repeatedly tried to overwhelm him in storms, he always
had the good fortune to win safely through!
</p>
<p>When he had gotten exactly half way across Australia, he came upon a very singular
sort of hill, rising in great slopes above the otherwise level country. Interested,
he stayed to closely examine it, climbing at last to the top. Whilst there, night
came on, and being very tired, he settled himself to sleep, selecting for a pillow
one of the numerous tussocks of grey-green grass which were growing all over the hill.
</p>
<p>Of other vegetation there was very little—only a few stunted trees, almost devoid
of leaves. But the hill itself spread over a very wide area indeed; and though in
many places sandy, there were other spots, as the Prince had seen, that were covered
with what looked like excellent soil; ready to grow anything if only plenty of water
were available. In point of fact, it was on these patches that the stunted trees were
growing, only saved from death, no doubt, by the falling of extremely rare showers
of rain. There were gorges and gullies too; but so dry from lack of water that only
the merest tuft of things were growing there. Round about the hill, as far as the
eye could see, and, further, stretched miles and miles of sandy desert!
</p>
<p>Just as the sun rose in the morning, the Prince awoke. In order to pull himself to
a sitting posture he clutched at one of the grass tussocks that grew near. To his
astonishment, it came easily out of the ground. But judge of his intense surprise,
when, gazing steadily into the hole left by the uprooted grass, he saw a tiny drop
of water slowly come through the soil at the bottom. Quickly replacing the tussock,
and firmly bedding the loosened earth round about it, he gave himself up to pondering
on the very peculiar fact that had just come under his observation.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb19">[<a href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="figure p019width"><img src="images/p019.png" alt="“To his intense astonishment it came easily out of the ground.”" width="613" height="720"><p class="figureHead">“To his intense astonishment it came easily out of the ground.”</p>
</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb21">[<a href="#pb21">21</a>]</span></p>
<p>After a while a great thought came to him. The drop of water he had seen could not
be there by itself. It must have come from some larger supply located deeper down
in the earth. If that were the case—and there could be no reason to doubt it—then
it might become possible to do many things, which, in his dreamings, he had often
planned to carry out if only the opportunity offered. Such, for example, as the building
of a new, safe, and perfectly wonderful City, the creation of a Fairy Navy; or the
erection of a glorious Palace greatly in advance of anything that had ever before
been seen.
</p>
<p>Almost all his life—maybe because he had so frequently noted the comparative scarcity
of water in the inland portions of Australia—he had thought of what might be done
with unlimited supplies. Here, then, appeared to be his golden opportunity. It was
a chance not to be missed!
</p>
<p>Giving up his quest of a wife, and hastening home with all speed, he secretly got
together a number of his more intimate friends and told them of his remarkable discovery.
He then persuaded them to join him in going back to the Well, in order to see what
might be done with its waters, and whether or not he could do some of the other things
about which he had been thinking; but, for fear of failure, he did not let his father
know of his return or of his intentions. For the same reason he did not tell his friends
what was in his mind; but he resolved that should the matter turn out as fortunately
as he hoped, to take them into his entire confidence and seek their assistance in
the carrying out of the great enterprises he had in view. So, having provided them
with everything he thought might be required for the works he proposed to carry out,
quietly and unobtrusively, off they set upon their mission.
</p>
<p>After surmounting many difficulties, in due course they arrived at the place where
Prince Waratah had rested a few weeks earlier. He very easily found the spot where
he had lain down to sleep, because, quite apart from a pile of stones he had set up
to mark it—the tussock he had disturbed was, consequent upon its getting a little
more water than it had previously been able to draw from the earth, much greener than
before. It was only the work of a moment to again pull <span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>it from its place, and there, sure enough, in a very few minutes the tiny bubble of
water appeared!
</p>
<p>To say that they all were deeply interested is to put it mildly. But they were not
allowed to waste much time in merely wondering from whence the water came. Acting
under the Prince’s orders, a circle was first drawn round the opening from which the
tussock had come. From centre to circumference the distance was six feet, so that
from edge to edge of the circle was exactly twelve feet. Within the circle they all
then set to work removing the earth, even the Prince himself digging away with the
others.
</p>
<p>Curiously enough, as the digging advanced, they found embedded in the soil several
implements such as are used by the Garden Fairies in cultivating their lands; just
exactly in the same way as people in England, in digging wells, often come across
old Roman coins or other articles. When they had reached a depth of about twelve feet,
meeting a little more moisture as they proceeded, they suddenly came upon some broad
flat stones. The Prince instantly ordered them all to stop working until he had looked
them over carefully, with a view to seeing how they might best be removed. Gently
stamping his foot to test the thickness of the stones, the Prince thought he detected
a somewhat hollow sound coming from underneath. Listening intently, he vigorously
stamped upon the particular stone upon which he was then standing. In doing so he
involuntarily stepped backwards, and, to his amazement, the stone immediately tip-tilted
a little, and out shot a long thin stream of clear cold water!
</p>
<p>Naturally enough, the startlingly sudden appearance of the water caused the Prince
to step still further back, with the result that when his weight was removed the stone
fell into its place again, and so shut off the water. But the secret was out! They
had found the entrance to a subterranean spring or well! Further experiments showed
that two stones, fitting together, formed a kind of trap-door barring the waters from
coming out. To open or close the trap-door stones required very little effort once
the trick was learned; and in accordance with the extent to which they were opened,
the amount of water released could be easily regulated.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb23">[<a href="#pb23">23</a>]</span></p>
<p>Of course they all got very wet indeed whilst they were learning the Secret of the
Well. But that gave them very little concern. The truth is, they were far too interested
to bother about so small a matter, and they eagerly awaited the further instructions
of the Prince. These were brief but effective. They were to replace the earth in the
Well; and, having done so, to so cover the whole with tussocks of grass as to make
it appear to any too enquiring eye that there were only an unusual number growing
there. A further advantage of placing so many together would be to serve as a distinguishing
mark, on their return in strength, to carry out the projects of which he would later
on inform them. Meantime, it was his wish that they should all return to their homes,
as he particularly desired to tell his father the wonderful news, and to consult him
as to the future.
</p>
<p>A little disappointed, perhaps, but nevertheless perfectly loyal to the Prince’s wishes,
they therefore set about returning. Arrived back, the Prince immediately waited upon
his father, King Eucalyptus, and, omitting no essential detail, told him the whole
story from the time when he first observed the tiny drop of water up to the actual
unearthing of the Well and the learning of how to release its waters.
</p>
<p>Very quietly the King listened to the end, smiling occasionally as the narrative proceeded.
When the Prince had finished he said: “The Well you have found once belonged to the
Garden Fairies. It is a Magic Well; and it is fed by an underground stream called
‘Fruitful River.’ The river will never run dry, no matter how much water is taken
from it. The Garden Fairies are now dispersed all over Australia; every tribe having
some of their number attached to it except the Desert Fairies and the Ocean Fairies.
It was the Desert Fairies who drove them out of their original home and scattered
them among the other tribes.
</p>
<p>“All this happened hundreds of years ago, but the Golden Fairies still tell the tale
of their lost possessions; and, though they are extremely peaceful and industrious,
in their hearts they loathe the Desert Fairies for the injuries done them.
</p>
<p>“It is said that the Desert Fairies, who are very vicious in their habits and also
very war-like, became envious of the prosperity <span class="pageNum" id="pb24">[<a href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>of the Garden Fairies, and resolved to attack and conquer them. This they did, but,
to their surprise, the war lasted for years and years, the Garden Fairies resisting
with all their might the malicious onslaughts of their enemies.
</p>
<p>“But the time came when they saw they must be defeated, and, rather than leave their
Sacred Well (from which they gained all they had) to the mercy of the Desert Fairies,
they resolved to seal it up with stones. This they successfully accomplished, covering
the seal with earth.
</p>
<p>“Then they left, but not before they sustained another terrific siege from the Desert
Fairies, who, determined to overcome them, threw enormous quantities of sand over
the whole place. If they had not done this they might afterwards have discovered just
where the Well was, but so completely had they done their wicked work that it was
almost impossible to tell one spot from another.
</p>
<p>“So the place has remained these many hundreds of years, till you, fortunately, have
had the good luck to find what the Desert Fairies have looked for in vain. Having
found the Magic Well, you are at liberty to ask me for such a favour connected with
it as may be within my power to bestow!”
</p>
<p>For a moment Prince Waratah was so taken aback at the unexpected conclusion to his
father’s remarks, that he could hardly find words to express himself. Quickly realising,
however, that here was an opening that might never occur again, he promptly asked
permission to give up for the time being his search for a wife, to go back to the
Well, and to take with him such of his friends, and so many of the working Fairies
as would enable him to begin his most cherished ambition—the building of the City
of his Dreams! It was of this he was thinking when he had said to his friends at the
Well that he would later on discuss with them projects of great importance.
</p>
<p>The King, under the circumstances, was only too delighted to give his consent, and
added that, if at any time the Prince found himself in any difficulty and wanted advice
and assistance, he was to come to him quite freely, and, as far as was possible, he
would be willingly helped. All of which goes to show that the King in his heart was
proud to find his son so full of enthusiasm, and was really desirous that he should
succeed.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb25">[<a href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="figure p025width"><img src="images/p025.png" alt="A DESERT FAIRY." width="321" height="319"><p class="figureHead">A DESERT FAIRY.</p>
</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span></p>
<p>With so many things in his favour, it is thus easy to understand the joy with which
Prince Waratah assembled his friends, and, taking them into his confidence, went into
the minutest details as to his proposals. But at the same time he strongly counselled
them not to mention or discuss his plans with anyone else; for he wanted everything
to be kept a close secret until the right time came to disclose it.
</p>
<p>The working Fairies were soon selected (about two thousand), but of course they were
not told where they were going, nor exactly what they were expected to do. They could
guess at things—that was all! And well might they exercise their minds in guessing,
for never before had they seen such extensive preparations for work on such a gigantic
scale. In the course of a few weeks there were got together hundreds of fairy barrows,
picks and shovels. Scores and scores of fairy saws, hammers, chisels, planes and screw-drivers.
Great quantities of timber; together with all kinds of machinery for making bricks,
tiles, and earthenware pipes. Besides all these things there were any number of pots
for holding paints, colours and varnishes, dozens and dozens of packages containing
nails, screws, clips and cleats. Others again were filled with catches, cords, pulleys,
and all sorts of small fittings. In addition, there were surveyors’ instruments and
engineers’ tools. In short, there was every class and kind of thing required, or likely
to be needed for the immense amount of work in contemplation.
</p>
<p>As to food, that also was carefully preserved and safely stowed in appropriate packages
and parcels. But more marvellous than all else, every machine package and parcel was
given a set of fairy legs on which to travel. These were most ingeniously made, filled
with electrical energy (which the Fairies know how to extract from the air), and then
fitted to the particular parcel or package they were to carry!
</p>
<p>When they were run down, just in the same way as the storage batteries which give
light to tram-cars are replenished, they were recharged with electricity, and off
they went again! Thus, when everybody and everything was ready to move out upon the
long trek, there was witnessed a sight the like of which can only be imagined; for
never before or since has such a thing been done.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span></p>
<p>First and foremost rode the Prince, mounted on a dainty milk-white pony not any larger
than a sheep. Close behind, riding chestnut ponies with silver manes and tails, all
about the same size as the Prince’s pony, came his chosen friends. It is said that
the horses from which these ponies were bred came originally from Spain. A boat load
of them was on its way to that part of Western America which is called California;
but, driven by storms and stress of weather, the ship was thrown out of its course,
and eventually wrecked on the East Coast of Australia. The Fairies rescued the horses,
fed and cared for them; and during the long years that followed, slowly bred them
down in size. Unfortunately they are all dead now; but at the time that the Prince
set out to build his Fairy City, they were at their prime. Other animals landed in
Australia have met with better luck, and have not died out. For instance, the Indian
buffaloes that were long ago placed on Melville Island have increased in number until
to-day there are thousands of them.
</p>
<p>But to continue! After the Prince’s personal friends, there followed on in proper
order, the Fairy workmen, all astride of dappled greys. Then came the surveyors’ instruments
and all the machinery, tools, packages and materials; the longest, strangest procession
that ever sallied forth from anywhere. At the extreme rear came the fairy cooks, with
all their pots and pans, and fairy fireplaces; everything spotlessly clean and shining
in the sunlight! The cooks all rode in fairy waggons, each about the size of a butter-box,
and as white as snow! The waggons were drawn by coal-black ponies, whose highly polished
coats rippled and shimmered whenever the sunbeams fell upon them. Surely never before
had there been seen so uncommon a sight in all the world!
</p>
<p>There is perhaps no need to mention that all the fairy folk not going with the Prince
turned out to see him and his retinue depart. Great was the cheering as each particular
section passed along; and many a one openly speculated as to where they were all journeying,
and what they were going to do. But the secret had been well kept, and all the guesses
were wide of the mark.
</p>
<p>When the Prince and his party were fairly on their way, everything seemed somewhat
quiet after the noisy send-off that had been <span class="pageNum" id="pb29">[<a href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>given them. He, therefore, sent word along the line that he would like them to sing
their new marching song. This particular song he had himself written, composed, and
taught them during the time when they were preparing for the task upon which they
had now set out. This is it:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Left! Right! Left! Right!
</p>
<p class="line">On we go from morn till night;
</p>
<p class="line">Heads up! Shoulders back!

<p class="line">Stepping straightly on the track!
</p>
<p class="line">Step strong! Move along!
</p>
<p class="line">Cheer the journey with a song!
</p>
<p class="line">Let the chorus roll and ring,

</p>
<p class="line">As we once again them sing!
</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line xd31e521">Step right! Keep bright!

</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pageNum" id="pb30">[<a href="#pb30">30</a>]</span></p>
<p>Nothing loath to comply with the Prince’s desire, they were soon heartily singing
the song, and much enjoyment they got from it. The fact is, that marching songs, as
a rule, have a very brightening effect upon the singers. Words and music are alike
intended to bring this about. Knowing this to be the case, and realising that as the
long day stretched itself out, many of his followers were certain to get very tired,
he deliberately chose such words and sentiments for his song as would tend to keep
their spirits up till night time, when they could rest!
</p>
<p>When at last night did arrive, Prince Waratah and all his company found themselves
in a very lovely wooded valley. It was an ideal place for camping. A little silver
stream supplied them with plenty of water. The dry leaves that had fallen from the
trees, and the smaller broken branches that lay around supplied them with kindling
and firewood; an extra supply of leaves also making very good bedding on which to
spread their sleeping rugs.
</p>
<p>After supper, feeling very comfortable and happy, they fell to humming the most delightful
tunes imaginable, crooning tunes, such as mothers sing to their babies; soft and low
and sweet. The effect was truly remarkable! In the course of fifteen or twenty minutes—just
as the stars began to peep at them through the gently swaying tree tops—they were
all sound asleep; or, to be quite accurate, all were asleep except the few guards
posted at fairly distant intervals along the outer edges of the camp. Their duty was
to watch out for any attack by possible enemies, such as the Mountain Fairies, who,
although not really wicked, sometimes take it into their heads to throw down huge
pieces of rock, or to send a giant tree hurtling over a cliff, to the great danger
of those who may be camped or passing below.
</p>
<p>Next morning everybody was stirring bright and early; and, after breakfast and packing
up, the march began again. So day followed day for many a day. Sometimes they travelled
up hill; sometimes down. Occasionally they had to make their way through timbered
country; and now and again a stream had to be crossed. But, like soldiers, they made
very light of such a passing difficulty, for they carried a certain number of pontoons
with them, and, throwing <span class="pageNum" id="pb31">[<a href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>them down as bridges, over the river they went in perfect safety. “Pont,” as you probably
know, is the French word for bridge; and “pontoons” are usually made of empty barrels
strung together to make a bridge. It was thus they crossed over waterways through
which they could not wade.
</p>
<p>But the time came when they left forest and stream behind them, and had to travel
over great stretches of land covered with coarse and stubbly grasses. It was not pleasant
by any means. Yet worse conditions were ahead; for when the rough grass lands were
finally crossed, they came to the great sandy desert. Sand, and yet more sand—nothing
but sand! Luckily they were not far from their destination. In two more days, the
Prince told them, they would be there. As a consequence they began the desert march
with a certain amount of light-heartedness, buoyed up by the thought that within a
very little while their wanderings would cease. Unhappily, however, before that time
arrived, they found themselves engaged in a terrific struggle with the Desert Fairies.
</p>
<p>These nomadic Fairies, possibly resentful of the coming of the others, or, maybe,
just because they are naturally nasty, viciously and vigorously attacked them in force.
</p>
<p>Following their usual tactics, they first brought up an extremely hot wind, and, driving
this before them full into the face of the wayfarers, sought to make them beat an
inglorious retreat. But in spite of the fearful discomfort which the scorching wind
brought to them, they kept steadily on; absolutely determined not to be turned from
their purpose by a hot wind, however fierce!
</p>
<p>Seeing, therefore, that this attack was a failure, the Desert Fairies resorted to
their dreadful second line of attack. Picking up vast quantities of sand—(which by
this time was doubly hot from the rays of the sun and the blistering wind that had
passed over it)—they flung it before them, seeking to choke, blind and burn the intrepid
adventurers. Eyes, ears and noses became partly filled with it. Under the strain,
lips blackened and cracked, and parched throats ached with a pain almost unendurable
as the onslaught developed in intensity! Yet, still undaunted, on they went! Their
courage and <span class="pageNum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>steadfastness were marvellous! Well might the Prince be proud of them! As a matter
of fact, foreseeing such a fight, he had repeatedly urged them, should it occur, not
to be dismayed and fall back, but to stand firm, and at the right moment, effective
help would certainly be forthcoming.
</p>
<p>And so it chanced! For, just when the contest seemed no longer possible of endurance,
and despair was about to bring panic to their midst, the Shower Fairies arrived, and,
with their pellet-like raindrops beat the sand particles down, cleared and cooled
the air, and with refreshing waters restored the faint and famished Fairies. More
remarkable than all, their late attackers, finding themselves thus bereft of their
weapons, turned tail and fled, leaving the Prince and his faithful followers masters
of the field.
</p>
<p>This was a wonderful victory, and serves to show how very wise the Prince was, and
with what profit he had reflected upon the things he had seen in his previous travels.
In particular, he had noted that the only thing the Desert Fairies fear is water,
especially in the form of raindrops. With great foresight he had, therefore, arranged
that there should follow on behind his company a tribe of Shower Fairies, ready to
act should the need arise. True, they were a little late, but this is accounted for
by the fact that each of them had to bring along a full supply of raindrops, and as
these are very heavy for such wee folk to carry—especially in the teeth of a hot driving
wind—they were somewhat longer in coming up than they should have been. Nevertheless
they were not too late, and, when they did come, their work was splendidly done.
</p>
<p>The way to the Magic Well was now clear! So, after bathing in the pools which the
Shower Fairies had created—(soon, alas! to disappear!)—they rested until the next
day. Then, in the highest possible spirits, they set about their final march, singing
with the greatest gusto as they went their famous marching chorus:—
</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the first story you were told how Prince Waratah, travelling in search of a wife,
found, by accident, “The Magic Well!” You were also told how the finding of the well
so inspired him, that he resolved to build a city round about it; and with this object
in view, set out with a great company of Fairies, fully equipped, to march across
Australia to where the Well is situated.
</p>
<p>As you will remember, they had nearly reached their destination when they were savagely
attacked by the Desert Fairies; but, with the timely aid of the Shower Fairies, the
enemy was successfully routed; and the tale concluded by telling how, rested and refreshed,
they all set out upon their final march, singing as they went.
</p>
<p>When in the early afternoon they arrived at the site of the Magic Well, a halt was
called; and for a little time everybody rested. Then, taking a company of working
Fairies to the top of the hill, the Prince directed them to remove the grass tussocks
he and his friends had planted to hide the opening to the Well from sight, and to
dig down until they were told to stop.
</p>
<p>These instructions they faithfully carried out; the Prince, meantime, watching their
work with the utmost interest.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb36">[<a href="#pb36">36</a>]</span></p>
<p>When, as he judged, they had gotten to within a few inches of the flat brown stones
which formed the trap-door entrance to the Well, he ordered them to retire; and calling
to those friends who on the previous occasion had seen it opened, he placed them in
charge pending further orders. He then instructed one of his Officers to parade the
entire Company close to the Well upon its Eastern side. This done, standing upon some
of the freshly thrown out earth, he told them that in a few minutes they should witness
a most engaging sight. In clear-cut language he followed this statement with a brief
narrative of the finding of the Well; its fascinating history as related to him by
his father; and an outline of his intentions with regard to the building of the Fairy
City. In this project, he added, he expected to receive their willing co-operation
and assistance; an expectation which his confidence in them led him to believe, would
be fully realised!
</p>
<p>As might have been expected, the speech was received with vociferous applause, which
applause almost reached a roar, when, at a wave of his hand, amidst the greatest curiosity
and excitement, his trusty officers within the Well, opened the door, and a great
stream of clear, cool, crystal water shot fountain-like into the air!
</p>
<p>If they had dared, they would at once have broken from their ranks and rushed pell-mell
to the side of the Well to see from whence the Water came; but, too thoroughly trained
to break discipline, they waited the command to dismiss.
</p>
<p>Before dismissing them, however, the Prince ordered the cooks and kitchen assistants
to retire and prepare an extra special open air supper. This, he said, was not only
to indicate his pleasure at the fact that at last they had arrived at the scene of
their future operations, but in token of his admiration of the way in which they had
borne themselves throughout the trials and terrors of their long and arduous march.
They were then released from duty; and whilst the meal was preparing, occupied the
time in a most minute examination of the Well and its surroundings.
</p>
<p>Just as supper was about to be served, and when everyone was in place, the Prince
rose and said: “Before partaking of the dainty viands now before us, I wish you all,
on this historic and maybe sacred <span class="pageNum" id="pb37">[<a href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>occasion, to rise and drink with me, in the waters of the Magic Well, all success
and enduring prosperity to the greatest enterprise ever initiated in Austral Fairy
Land ‘The Building of the Fairy City!’ ” Immediately all stood up, and with cheers
that almost reached the sky, quaffed a fairy flagon of clearest water to the Prince’s
Toast.
</p>
<p>A “Fairy flagon,” you should know, is made up of Gum leaves put into moulds, points
up, and pressed into the shape required. To hold the leaves together, and to make
the flagon retain its shape, a kind of cement is used, made from an extract of black
ants’ milk and beeswax. It is very binding, and in addition, takes on a most beautiful
polish, through which the gum leaves shine as clearly as do fruits or flowers that
are preserved in ice.
</p>
<p>Now the waters of the Well have a very singular and happy effect upon all who drink
of them; for though the Prince had not said a word about it, they contain certain
life-giving properties which bring to those who drink them the most enchanting results.
It is because of these peculiar properties that the Well is a Magic Well; its waters
work wonders in a way that cannot be seen. Thus, shortly after drinking of them, the
Fairies found themselves greatly stimulated and exhilarated in spirits. But their
prime quality lies in their power to rejuvenate those who partake of them. That is
to say they have the effect of making one young, and strong, and active again, no
matter how tired or worn out one may have been beforehand.
</p>
<p>But to resume! After supper—and a very fine one it was, too!—as usual, they sang their
crooning lullaby songs until all except the sentry guards fell off in sleep.
</p>
<p>Next morning, their strength renewed—rejuvenated, in fact—just as the golden lances
of the sun came piercing through the fast dispersing clouds of night, they woke, ready
and eager for any kind of work there might be to do. And certainly there was no shortage
of employment. As soon as breakfast was over the Surveyors looked out their instruments
and made ready to determine the limits and proportions of the intended city and grounds.
Very clever fellows are the Surveyors. And yet all their skill is based upon a thorough
grasp of a few simple facts. They know, that just as the alphabet is called the A
B C, because in those letters are contained every line <span class="pageNum" id="pb38">[<a href="#pb38">38</a>]</span>and curve that is necessary to the formation of any of the other twenty-three letters;
so, within the circle, ◯, the square, ◻, and the triangle, △, are to be found every
line and curve, and every degree of measurement that can possibly be used in the laying
out or building of anything in the world, from the Pyramids to a Modern Battleship!
</p>
<p>Using the Magic Well as a centre from which to start, they first ran a line two miles
due East, and a second one two miles due West. Returning, they did the like thing
two miles North and two miles South. Then, just as a boy uses a piece of string tied
to a stick stuck in the ground to draw a big ring in which to play marbles, so they,
by means of a large number of pegs, made a circle exactly twelve miles in circumference,
right round the base of the hill. In this way there was enclosed an area of ground
that was precisely four miles across, no matter from what part of the outer edge the
start was made.
</p>
<p>As soon as the ring was clearly marked, a small army of Fairies were put to work all
along its outer edge, digging out a trench twelve feet wide and four feet deep. Later
on, this trench was made fifty-two feet wide and twelve feet deep. As the earth was
taken out it was speedily removed by another army of fairy workmen and deposited on
different parts of the Hill pointed out by the Prince’s Engineers, to be used later
on in the making of lakelets, lily-pools, waterfalls, and all manner of delightful
arbors, rose gardens, lavender beds, pansy plots, daffodil rings, and a thousand and
one other altogether beautiful things meant for glorious display.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, certain specially qualified engineers—who really belonged to the
Cave Fairies, and therefore fully understood underground tunnelling and mining—having
been persuaded by Prince Waratah to join his forces, were industriously directing
the sinking of four great pits close beside the Magic Well. Each of these pits was
situated directly under one of the lines running North, South, East and West. When
they were sunken thirteen feet, sloping tunnels were begun, which tunnels, following
exactly beneath the lines drawn on top, ultimately found an opening into the great
trench on the rim of the circle two miles away.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span></p>
<p>But, of course, none of this work went on without interruption. It was only a matter
of a very few days, when the Desert Fairies, impelled by curiosity, came to see what
was going on. The great trench, which, as you will have surmised, was being digged
to form a circular lake, first attracted their attention. And very much it puzzled
them. What it all meant they could not understand; but, true to their vicious instincts,
they soon made up their minds to try and destroy it. This they sought to accomplish
by blowing immense quantities of loose sand into the excavation; thereby making it
necessary to do the work all over again.
</p>
<p>If, for the future prevention of this wanton and dastardly outrage, no remedy could
have been found, here was an end to the making of the Lake. But there were brains
among the Prince’s Engineers, and one of them very cleverly constructed a most ingenious
device for counteracting or stopping the flying sand. In a certain spot in one of
the otherwise dry and sterile gorges, watered in some way not yet discovered, he had
seen a very large number of bamboos growing. They were of all sizes; from the thickness
of a lead pencil to the circumference of a man’s wrist; and being very sheltered from
the wind, they were all extremely tall. Getting a huge quantity of them brought up
from the gorge, he first had them cleared of inside pith so as to leave a free passage
from end to end. Taking the thinner ones, he had tiny holes bored into them about
half an inch apart. This done, he fitted them, straight up and down, into a frame
of the thickest ones, twelve feet square. When a number of these squares had been
so fitted, they were taken to the outside edge of the Trench, and there set up by
means of props or stays, also made of bamboo. A long line of bamboo piping was then
laid to each of the squares, and duly fitted into that portion of the frame which
touched the ground.
</p>
<p>As can be seen, all that was now needed, was a supply of water rushing through the
pipes to burst through the holes—no bigger than those in a gas burner—to make a water
sprayer of astonishing value in beating down every grain of sand that came against
it.
</p>
<p>Very ingenious also, was the way in which this feat was accomplished! An enormous
basket-basin was first woven out of bamboo <span class="pageNum" id="pb40">[<a href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>leaves and thoroughly stiffened with beeswax. It was then set upon pillars, made with
stones taken from the ground, right against the opening to the Well. In appearance
it looked something like the high round tanks one sees at railway stations. There
was this curious difference, however, that through the bottom of the basin bamboo
pipes came down, and these were joined to the other pipes that were to take the water
to the squares.
</p>
<p>Now it has to be remembered, that when the trapdoor of the Magic Well was opened,
the water shot upwards into the air. To permit of the basin being placed in position,
and for other reasons, the door had been closed and the water shut off. To make it
fall into the basin when it should be again released, a kind of stand-pipe, surmounted
by a concave shield something the shape of a reaping hook, was so erected as to be
behind and over the water as it would rise. The shield, like the basin, was made of
waxed bamboo leaves.
</p>
<p>In due course, everything being ready, the trap-door was again opened, and, just as
expected, the rising column of water struck the shield, and, running along its concave
curve, poured downwards into the basin. For a little time the water seemed to leave
the basin faster than it was received; but that was not really the case, for the engineer
had calculated the matter to such a nicety, that not until the basin was almost brimming,
and the weight of the water helped, did it empty as quickly as it was filled.
</p>
<p>And what a sight it was when the squares sent out their spraying, sparkling streams
of water! No wonder the Desert Fairies drew back in startled amazement. Rain they
knew! A travelling water-spout they had seen and marvelled at! But here was something
past all comprehension; a hundred thousand never-stopping jets of water, shooting
straight at them, and, more weird and awe-inspiring than anything they had ever heard
or seen before—giving out the strangest music, and the most brilliant colours, as
the wind and sun played in and out among them.
</p>
<p>Very soon they saw the results of the water’s action. Everywhere within range the
sand lay flat and heavy; and try as they might, every attempt to fling the loose grains
through the spraying water into the trench was a dismal failure. They were completely
<span class="pageNum" id="pb41">[<a href="#pb41">41</a>]</span>worsted, and for many a day thereafter the Fairy Workmen were allowed to follow their
pursuits in unmolested freedom.
</p>
<p>Having now rid themselves of the attacks of the Desert Fairies, the work of laying
out the City and surroundings rapidly advanced. In particular, four things were pushed
ahead with all possible speed. They were, the finishing of the great trench, the completion
of the tunnels through which the water was to flow to fill it; the building of a very
large basin and ornamental fountain over the pits and opening to the Well, and the
construction, underneath the basin, of simple but effective machinery for the control
and regulation of the waters of the Well.
</p>
<p>In due time they were all finished, and ready to be put in use. Prince Waratah thereupon
declared a general holiday in order that all might take part in the first and most
important event connected with their venture, namely, the turning on of the water
that was to transform the trench into a Lake, and, in so doing, convert what had hitherto
been a hill in the desert, into Fairy Island!
</p>
<p>They were therefore asked to assemble round about the Fountain, which, up to that
day had been screened from view, what time those engaged upon its erection carried
out their task. Now, exposed to all beholders, they saw that it consisted of three
parts. First, there was the great black polished marble base, several feet in depth.
Upon this base there rested a projecting white marble basin in the shape of an enormous
water-lily; whilst the Fountain itself—made of greenish coloured bronze, rising from
the centre—was so fashioned as to represent a glorious bunch of Waratah blooms, from
the middle of which, a good deal taller than the rest, a very prince of Waratahs appeared!
</p>
<p>When the Fountain was in action, from every tiniest petal of these mimic blossoms
was meant to shoot a delicate spray of clearest water; whilst the lofty central flower
would send a shaft sheer into the sunlight! And so cleverly was everything adjusted
and arranged, that not a drop of water was wasted. It all fell into the basin; and
by means of neatly hidden overflow pipes, ran into the pits beneath, and so through
the tunnels into the lake!
</p>
<p>All this, however, is anticipating the event.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb42">[<a href="#pb42">42</a>]</span></p>
<p>At twelve o’clock precisely, in accordance with the Prince’s orders, the levers of
the machinery, out of sight beneath the basin, were swiftly reversed. Instantly the
Fountain began to play! From the bunched blossoms burst a misty spray; soft, cool
and altogether delightful; especially when a number of gaily coloured rainbow tints
peeked and pranced and revelled through and through it! In addition, high into the
air from the central flower, shot a silver shaft of water; that, breaking as it fell,
seemed to tremble into unnumbered strings and sprays of diamonds, zircons, tourmalines,
topazes and opals, as the sun’s rays glanced and gleamed amid the glistening drops!
The spectacle was both charming and delightful; and the Fairies cheered and cheered
again at the varying effects!
</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, as often happens in a crowd, they broke into bands; some to go this
way, and some that. Naturally enough, by far the greatest number of bands made for
the Trench; for of course everybody was anxious to see what was there taking place.
Almost before they arrived, however, the water came running through the tunnels; and,
as they stood watching, steadily began to make its way from edge to edge. Of course
it took many and many a day to fill; but, with a never stopping supply of water pouring
into it from North, East, West and South, fill it did; and has remained so filled
ever since!
</p>
<p>Now the creation of this great Lake round about the land chosen for the Fairy City,
and its gardens and grounds, not only acted as a bar to certain enemies, but so vast
a quantity of cool fresh water had a miraculous effect upon the atmosphere. It became
more humid, more moist. Trees and shrubs that could not have lived there before, no
matter how much water might have been given them, now flourished amazingly. Flowers,
fruits and other edibles of all kinds grew to perfection with astonishing rapidity.
Birds of every sort and description, attracted in some mysterious way to the Lake
and Hill, came in hundreds and settled there permanently. Bees, Beetles, Butterflies,
and Moths, in like manner, came, as it were, out of space, to find a new, and possibly,
a happier home than they had ever known before.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb43">[<a href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>
</p>
<div class="figure p043width"><img src="images/p043.png" alt="“Instantly the fountain began to play.”" width="608" height="720"><p class="figureHead">“Instantly the fountain began to play.”</p>
</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb45">[<a href="#pb45">45</a>]</span></p>
<p>In an incredibly short space of time, therefore, the place became bright with the
strains of feathered songsters and the glitter of their gaily plumaged friends.
</p>
<p>About the Hill Miniature Forests were planted and grew as if by magic.
</p>
<p>On the outer edge of the Lake, partly to honour his noble Father, King Eucalyptus;
but also to act as permanent protection against the detestable Desert Fairies, who,
like the Bedouins of the African desert, are always on the look-out to despoil and
destroy, Prince Waratah caused to be planted a magnificent belt of Eucalypts. This
great forest of truly splendid trees stretched in an unbroken line right round the
Lake, and very soon became a joy to all beholders, and the dwelling place of every
Australian animal that can be named. How they got there must for ever remain a mystery;
but there is good reason to believe that Prince Waratah, who loved everything Australian,
sent out Fairy scouts and messengers, mounted upon storks, cranes, and native companions,
to tell them all about the New World, so to speak, and to bring them there!
</p>
<p>As to the City, that soon began to show itself!
</p>
<p>Following upon the general plan marked out by the Surveyors, high up on the hillsides
pretty fairy residences were erected, their coloured roofs and snow-white fronts standing
sharply out amid the trees and shrubbery scattered round about them. How all this
work was done would take far too long to tell; but to give you an idea of what the
City and surroundings looked like after they were finished, imagine yourselves going
there on a visit.
</p>
<p>Having arrived at the great belt of Eucalyptus trees surrounding the Lake, you would
probably be directed by a Fairy Forest Ranger to one of the many narrow paths leading
to what is called “The Outer Causeway.” Taking the direction indicated, on coming
through the forest, there would suddenly break upon your sight a gloriously beautiful
Garden City set upon a Hill. At the foot of the Hill, running in a wide band completely
round it, blue as the skies above, lie the waters of a serene and lovely lake. In
some respects, this water circlet is not unlike the ring that surrounds Saturn, as
<span class="pageNum" id="pb46">[<a href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>pictured in the books dealing with Astronomy; but this impression vanishes the nearer
its margin is approached.
</p>
<p>When you reach the “Outer Causeway,” you discover that it is a wide flat pathway,
made of concrete bordered with red granite; and that it encompasses or surrounds the
whole of the lake. Where it touches the water, at equal distances apart, there stand
three hundred and sixty-five rough-cut grey granite pillars; one for every day of
the year, each seven feet high, to represent the days of the week. On the top of each
of these pillars a perfectly round lamp has been placed; whilst at the foot, iron
bolts and rings have been affixed. Thus the Pillars are not only useful for lighting
purposes, but they also serve as Moorings for Boats.
</p>
<p>Getting into one of the many Ferry Boats that cross from shore to shore, in due course
a landing is made on the “Inner Causeway.” Like its namesake, it also is a wide flat
pathway; but in this case it is made of White Marble bordered with polished red granite;
and it encloses or encompasses the whole of Fairy Island. On its outer rim; that is
to say, on the side that touches the water, at equal distances apart, there are placed
three hundred and sixty-five pillars of plain burnished copper, each four feet high;
and, linked to these, are a double row of brass chains, polished and lacquered to
the colour of sunset gold.
</p>
<p>At the proper landing places, these chains are detachable, and attendant Fairies are
in readiness to remove them as the boats arrive. Passengers are thus enabled to step
ashore without inconvenience or trouble.
</p>
<p>There are only four landing places; and from each of them runs a white marble path
that leads to one of the four City Entrance Gates.
</p>
<p>The four gates, which are placed North, East, West and South of the City, are set
in a very strong wall of polished red granite, twelve feet high and thirteen inches
thick, representative, of course, of the months of a year. Built into, and incorporated
with the wall, and made of the same material, at even distances apart, are fifty-two
watch towers, each seven feet high, one for each week of a year. These are surmounted
by pillars of exquisitely wrought copper, <span class="pageNum" id="pb47">[<a href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>capped by star-shaped electric torches that, throughout the livelong night, send their
searchlight beams across the Lake.
</p>
<p>The Entrance Gates are perfect in proportion and design. They are made of copper;
and each bears upon its central shield, in burnished brass, certain singular figures
that to those who study them, are full of meaning, and carry many a useful lesson.
The Eastern Gate, for example, is ornamented with a truly life-like picture of the
Sun rising from a slightly ruffled sea into the cloud-crossed Heavens. In popular
phrase, this is known as “Day’s Gate”; but it is really meant to indicate the entry
into life, wherein there are many clouds of ignorance and doubt, to be swept away
by bringing to bear on them the light of education, thought, and reason.
</p>
<p>The Western Gate, quite apart from its geographical position, is easily picked out
by reason of the fact that it bears upon its face a striking likeness of the Full
Moon bursting through the misty vapours of the night into the high unclouded skies.
This is styled “Night’s Gate”; but that is but a poor attempt at imagery, for its
purpose is to typify the way in which the pure souls of men and women rise above the
mists of death and make their way to the free clear spaces far, far above the world.
</p>
<p>On the Northern Gate appears a representation of our own earth, seemingly buffeted
about by stormy winds and lightning flashes; but still steadily pursuing its appointed
way. The portion of the World most prominently displayed is Australia. In this case
the name commonly given is “Earth’s Gate.” It is, however, a very inadequate title,
for it is intended to convey the idea that duty and love of country are two of the
greatest virtues; and that the endeavour of everyone should be, in spite of trouble
or adversity, to continue along the path believed to be right, and in so doing, to
remember that one’s native land should ever be uppermost both in private and in public
effort.
</p>
<p>The Southern Gate has emblazoned upon it a portion of what a poet has described as
“That inverted bowl we call the sky.” In this instance the “Milky Way” is pictured;
and prominent among the Stars beneath, the Southern Cross is shown. Generally speaking
this is called “Heaven’s Gate,” and is a much more expressive <span class="pageNum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>term than that which has been applied to any of the others. Nevertheless, the name
given does not fully cover its inner import or meaning. As is well known, the “Milky
Way” is caused by the massing, or bringing close to each other, of a very great number
of stars; and, as their lights mingle, there is produced the strange, spilled milk
effect, which gave rise to the descriptive appellation. But that is by the way! What
it is meant to convey to those seeing it featured on the Gate, is the idea that Heaven’s
Gate is guarded by an innumerable host of Angels—milk white in their purity—who will
not allow anyone to pass except by right! And only those have the “right” to enter
Heaven, who, by their good conduct, truth telling, and <span class="corr" id="xd31e717" title="Source: straghtforwardness">straightforwardness</span>, are fit and proper persons to be admitted to the Kingdom of God! The Southern Cross
beneath, with its five glowing stars, represents Faith. Not that blind kind of faith
which just believes a thing because someone has said that it is true; but one that
is based on the fullest use of the five senses of Touch, Taste, Sight, Smell and Hearing,
which have been given us as aids to understanding and knowledge.
</p>
<p>Such, then, is a brief description of the Gates of Fairy Land; through one of which,
to enter the City, everyone must pass. There is but one other remark to make concerning
them. Whenever there is any reason for them to be mentioned, the order in which their
names are given is always Northern, Eastern, Western, and Southern. This is so because
the initial letters when put together spell N-E-W-S; and it is in this way that the
Fairies contrive to give a constant reminder to everybody interested that they are
well informed as to what is taking place in the four quarters of the Globe; without
which information, they would, of course, be very sadly behind the times.
</p>
<p>Having passed through one of the Entrance Gates, the first thing to strike the eye
is a long path covered with golden coloured gravel. On either side of the path there
is a green grass border. One of the reasons for having these borders is, that gold
and green are Australia’s National colours, and as the Fairies are very patriotic,
it is easy to understand the significance or meaning of this delightful arrangement.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb49">[<a href="#pb49">49</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p049width" id="p049"><img src="images/p049.jpg" alt="“To see the city at its best, it must be viewed at night.”" width="589" height="720"><p class="figureHead">“To see the city at its best, it must be viewed at night<span class="corr" id="xd31e728" title="Source: ,">.</span>”</p>
</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb51">[<a href="#pb51">51</a>]</span></p>
<p>At each of the Gates an exactly similar path may be seen. They run in straight lines
to the Fountain and Gardens at the top of the Hill; and they are laid directly over
the tunnels that carry the water from the Magic Well to the Lake. As a consequence,
they serve more than one purpose. Firstly, they divide the city into four great triangles
of exactly equal dimensions. Next, they give access from the four cardinal points
of the Compass to the Prince’s Palace and to the Fountain Gardens. Lastly, whilst
completely hiding the tunnels from view, they make them easy to get at in case of
accident. To have had any buildings above or across the water tunnels would have been
a very great mistake; for quite apart from the difficulty of making repairs, if such
were necessary, the weight of the erections might have brought about the very trouble
it was desirable to avoid.
</p>
<p>All the other paths run in circles. There are very many of them; but their number
has never been told. Facing all the paths or streets, Fairy Houses have been built—dainty
little dwellings of the quaintest patterns imaginable; but all of them having a piece
of garden ground to add to the effect. The houses of the Prince’s officers and the
Fairy Leaders are on the four main straight streets; those of the other Fairies are
on what may be termed the circular streets. The Prince has had reserved for his own
use a very fine piece of land facing the Fountain on the flat top of the Hill. Here
his wonderful Palace is erected, the foundations for which were laid even before the
Lake was made.
</p>
<p>But to see the City at its best, it must be viewed at night, when the artistic lighting
arrangements show it up in all its glory.
</p>
<p>Before attempting to describe the lights, or the perfectly entrancing effects they
produce, it has to be stated that the streets are, by the Fairies themselves, called
the “streets of the stars.” Hence it is quite common to hear such names as the “Street
of the Southern Cross<span id="xd31e739"></span>”; the “Street of Orion”; the “Street of Canopus”; or the “Street of Mars.” This arises
from the fact that Stars and constellations have been used as lighting models. The
constellations, or groups of stars, are in use for the broader streets, and at all
crossing centres; whilst the stars have been copied for the narrower streets and for
the watch-towers on the wall.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb52">[<a href="#pb52">52</a>]</span></p>
<p>As an example of many others, the Street of the Southern Cross will do to illustrate
the way in which the City is lighted.
</p>
<p>Here, at regular intervals apart, stand very finely made copper lamp-pillars. They
have all been treated to what is called “oxidation”; with the result that they have
an elusive sheen or polish about them that is very attractive to the eye. To further
enrich them, and make them still more beautiful to behold, they are inlaid with burnished
silver in pretty trailing designs borrowed from some of Australia’s best known plants
of a creeping or climbing habit. Among the number may be seen the purple Sarsaparilla;
the white Forest Queen, and Sturt’s Desert Pea. On the head of each pillar is placed
an exact model or copy of the Southern Cross, from whose five stars there pours a
flood of light from night till morning. When all the lamps in all the streets are
thus sending forth their rays, the combined effect is positively glorious. The City
seems, as it were, clothed in light; soft and delicate; and yet so clear as to bring
to richer beauty everything it touches. Houses and gardens, clearly seen, are yet
dream-like in their loveliness. Trees and Fountains; Lily ponds and Lavender beds;
Water-falls, grottos, gorges, valleys; all are magically and mysteriously still, and
wondrously beautiful! Viewed in this way, it is indeed a Fairy City, and a fit and
proper setting for the crowning jewel of all its architectural and other wonders:
The Prince’s Palace!
</p>
<p>But of that Palace, and of all its marvels, time does not permit to tell. That is
a story which must be reserved for another occasion. Suffice it to say, that when
it was at last finished and furnished, many there were who thought that it was time
the Prince renewed his search for a wife; for here indeed was a Palace fit for any
Princess on earth!

<p class="line xd31e521">To grace the Fairy Isle!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Now the building of the Prince’s Palace was the greatest piece of work performed in
Fairy Land.
</p>
<p>As you know, very many wonderful things were done with regard to the making of the
Lake and the construction of the Fairy City. But all these suffer by comparison with
what was accomplished in connection with the Palace. It is built of the purest white
Marble, Facing the Fountain, on part of the flat top of the Hill, it stands amidst
the most spacious garden grounds, and can be seen from every part of the City. It
contains exactly twenty-four rooms: one for every hour of the day. They are divided
into three equal sets. In one of these sets the whole of the work of the Palace is
<span class="pageNum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>carried out. Another set is devoted to pleasure and amusement; whilst above these
are the rooms in which to rest or sleep.
</p>
<p>From the white marble steps leading from the balconied verandah at the great front
entrance to the Palace, a broad level pathway sweeps in a half circle out to the circular
path which surrounds the Fountain gardens. Thus the Palace and the Fountain Gardens
join each other. Like all the other paths, it is covered with golden coloured gravel;
and, flanking it on either side, set in the loveliest of green grass lawns, there
run two delightful flower-beds; forever filled with golden marigolds!
</p>
<p>The high double doors which give entry to the Palace are made of oxidised, or slightly
darkened silver, and stained glass. They are set in a splendid framework made of the
same kind of silver; and this, and the lower panels of the doors, are inlaid with
delicate designs in burnished gold. On the framework, the design takes the form of
the trailing Sarsaparilla; whilst the panels are decorated with exquisitely executed
bunches of flannel flowers surrounded with an oval border of Eucalyptus leaves. The
glass in the upper halves of the doors, richer than any to be seen in old Cathedral
windows, has had burned into it, in their own natural colours, Wattle blossoms and
Waratah blooms. The Wattle blossoms occupy the centre panels, and the torch-like Waratahs
are placed at either side.
</p>
<p>Through the doors one passes into a wide Hall, out of which rises a branching stairway
giving access to the rooms above. The Hall is paved with gorgeous tiles and lined
with “fiddle-back” blackwood. The Hall seats are made of the same beautiful wood.
On one side of the Hall, framed in silver, there is a picture of a hive of bees; and
on the other side, also in a silver frame, there is a picture of an Ant-Hill; both
indicative of work or industry.
</p>
<p>But perhaps, before going further, you would like to know how the Fairies make the
lovely tiles which pave the Hall. It is really rather interesting, and serves to show
how very clever they are. Well! This is what they do!
</p>
<div class="figure p055width"><img src="images/p055.png" alt="A FLOWER FAIRY." width="326" height="682"><p class="figureHead">A FLOWER FAIRY.</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>When the wind blows the petals from the flowers—as it does every day—the Fairies at
night time go and collect them. They at once dip them into a mixture made of an extract
of black ants’ milk, <span class="pageNum" id="pb57">[<a href="#pb57">57</a>]</span>clear honey, and morning dew. How they make it has never been found out; but it has
a truly surprising effect in preserving both the shape and colours of the petals.
They then put them into moulds the size and shape of the tiles they propose to make;
press them very tightly together; and lightly brushing the face of each tile so made
with a little more of the mixture in order to cover it with a kind of glaze, set them
up in the sunlight to dry. The drying finished, they put them through some kind of
electrical treatment to make them hard, and they are then almost ready for use.
</p>
<p>Before putting them in place however; by a secret process quite impossible to discover;
they make the actual outline of the flower itself to appear through the glaze; and,
more bewildering still, they cause the perfume of whatever flower petals have been
used, to come back to them. They are thus enabled to faintly scent a room or hall
with whatever pleasant odour they like to choose; the result of which is, that knowing
the particular flower that one loves best, they can pay him or her a most delicate
compliment, by simply introducing the perfumes of his or her favourite flower to the
house or rooms he or she is to occupy.
</p>
<p>As it happens, the flowers used in the making of the Hall floor tiles were wattle-blossoms.
They were selected, partly because of the sunny effect to be obtained from their golden
colour; and partly because Prince Waratah—who by this time had seen Princess Wattle
Blossom and fallen in love with her—had made up his mind that some day she should
be his wife. How he first came to visit the father of the lovely Princess, and the
manner of his going, are now a matter of tradition; but at the time the journey took
place it was looked upon as an almost miraculous performance.
</p>
<p>As you will remember, when the Prince first found the Magic Well, he was on his way
to visit the Wattle Fairies, who lived in that part of Australia now called Victoria.
But in consequence of his important and probably far-reaching discovery, he gave up
his search for a wife; returned to his father, King Eucalyptus, and sought and obtained
permission to undertake the building of a new Fairy City round the Magic Well.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb58">[<a href="#pb58">58</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the City was finished, and the Palace well on the way, he began to think that
a Palace without a Princess would be a very poor thing indeed, and more or less useless.
Quite naturally therefore, his thoughts reverted to the Wattle Fairies, of whom he
had heard it said that they were the most beautiful in all the World. The more he
turned the matter over in his mind, the more he desired to make the visit upon which
he had started so long ago.
</p>
<p>But there were difficulties in the way. To take an escort of sufficient strength to
resist possible enemy attacks, meant delaying the erection of the Palace for quite
a considerable length of time. In addition, his personal supervision would be lacking,
and mistakes might occur.
</p>
<p>Pondering over these and other matters, there one day flashed into his mind a rather
quaint idea. Without any loss of time he sent for the Engineer Fairy; the one who
had made the bamboo squares from which the water was sprayed when the Desert Fairies
tried to fill the great Trench with sand. And this is what he said: “Hail! and greeting!
O clever Engineer!” And the Engineer replied, “Hail! O Prince! Forever at your service!”
“Engineer,” said the Prince, “I would that I could take a voyage through the air;
and being seized with an idea, I have a mind to discuss it with thee. Listen then,
O Engineer! and answer me in good time! As thou wert able to fill the hollow bamboo
stalks with water—to the great undoing of our common enemy the Desert Fairies—canst
thou not fill some others with air, and, having done so, construct me a carriage that
might, like a bird, fly safely overhead?”
</p>
<p>As you may well believe, so unexpected a question could not be given an instant answer.
It is doubtful indeed if the Prince himself expected any other than he got. What the
Engineer Fairy said in reply was: “Permit, O Prince, thy servant time to think, and
he will answer thee anon!” “Granted, most worthy Engineer!” said the Prince; “not
until thou thyself do broach this matter again shall it be named betwixt us twain.”
And the Prince rose in sign of dismissal.
</p>
<p>When the Engineer Fairy had time to think over the things the Prince had said to him
he was greatly pleased at having been called <span class="pageNum" id="pb59">[<a href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>“most worthy Engineer,” and he set about his novel task with the greatest good-will.
</p>
<p>Taking the hint given him by Prince Waratah, he got together a goodly number of bamboo
stalks, most of them no thicker than a lady’s little finger. Carefully removing the
inside pith, he first inserted a bark cork into the open end, and then covered it
with a seal. The seals he used were made of hard brown gum-nuts; and in order that
the bamboo tubes should be perfectly air-tight, he dipped their ends into hot melted
beeswax before screwing on the cap-nuts. The effect was just the same as when hot
paraffin wax is poured on top of a jar of newly made jam—nothing could either get
out or in. Having in this way effectually sealed one end, he then, by means of a little
electrical bellows, proceeded to fill the tubes with air, so full that they were almost
ready to burst. But before that could happen, he deftly slipped a bark cork into position,
swiftly dipped the unsealed end into the hot melted beeswax, and without losing an
instant of time, rapidly screwed on the cap-nut, thus sealing that end as closely
as the other.
</p>
<p>As soon as a sufficient number of various lengths and sizes had been filled with air,
they were put together in the shape of a chair, with a box beneath the seat. The chair
was then upholstered, or covered with finely woven rushes over a padding of moss;
thus making it a very comfortable one in which to sit.
</p>
<p>To make it easy to move, four little wheels were attached; and to protect the occupant
from the rain or sun a hood could be raised or lowered by simply moving a lever at
the left side. This hood, as well as a rug to cover the knees, was made of spider-webs
as soft as a baby’s hair. The late Queen Victoria had presented to her by the Natives
of India an exceedingly fine shawl made of the same kind of material.
</p>
<p>But the most curious thing about the chair was its two wings, one at either side.
They were as large as the wings of an eagle, and of the same shape, and they were
entirely covered with the soft green feathers of rosella parrots. As was seen later
on, they could be folded back against the chair, or set to any angle desired, according
to the way in which their controlling mechanism was turned. <span class="pageNum" id="pb60">[<a href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>To the front of the chair four rings were affixed, but for what purpose was not made
clear until they were about to be used.
</p>
<p>What was then disclosed was this: The chair was in reality a flying carriage; the
box underneath being intended to hold whatever the driver might wish to take by way
of food, clothes or other things. The four rings in the front were to be used as couplings
to which to attach an astonishingly swift team of Blue Kingfishers, sixteen in number,
who were to pull the carriage through the air. The Birds’ harness was made of light,
but strong, honey coloured ropes, twisted out of strands of silk taken from the spiders
who spin that kind of thread. The spiders originally came from Papua or New Guinea,
and the threads they spin are coarser than those which the silk-worms produce; but
none the less very useful for such a purpose as that to which they were being put.
</p>
<p>Of course it took some time to learn all these details. As a matter of fact, it was
not until the Engineer Fairy gave his first demonstration that they were all seen
and understood.
</p>
<p>What then took place needs but a few words to describe. The Prince, being present,
and everything in readiness, the Engineer sat himself in the seat, lifted the silk
reins, spoke to the team of Blue Kingfishers, and off they set at a smart run—the
flying carriage running on its wheels behind them. Presently they all rose as one
bird into the air, and at the self-same moment the carriage also rose, and, with wings
outspread, flashed behind the flying Kingfishers as perfectly balanced and as steady
as a modern aeroplane.
</p>
<p>When in a little time the Engineer Fairy returned, he carefully explained to the Prince
all that was required to be done, and very respectfully suggested that he should try
his hand.
</p>
<p>Nothing loath, apparently, Prince Waratah took the driver’s seat, and faithfully and
implicitly obeying the instructions given him, managed to make a very skilful flight
indeed, all things considered. Later, by much practice, he became so proficient that
it was next to impossible for him to come to harm.
</p>
<p>It was then that he set out, alone, to visit the Wattle Fairies, covering the distance
in an extremely short space of time compared with what would have been necessary had
he ridden on horseback <span class="pageNum" id="pb61">[<a href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>or walked. Maybe you can imagine the consternation and excitement among them the first
time they descried him coming through the air. When first sighted he was little more
than a speck in the far distance; but all Fairies have very keen eyesight, and watching
intently, it was not very long before they could discern the brilliant blue plumage
of the Kingfishers, the flashing of their honey-coloured harness as the sunbeams touched
it every now and then; and, above all, the Prince himself in the yellow flying carriage
with the great green wings attached!
</p>
<p>No wonder they felt alarmed. It was enough to strike terror into the heart of anyone
who had never seen such a strange and unusual sight before; and had it not been for
the wisdom and calmness of their King, it is almost certain they would have fled helter-skelter
from the scene. But he, not knowing what else to think, boldly and confidently asserted
that the stranger flying towards them must be a messenger from Heaven, and as Heaven
was kind, there was really nothing to fear. “Of a truth,” said he, “it is more than
possible that some great blessing is about to be bestowed upon us. Let us therefore
await God’s messenger calmly and fearlessly; and in due time we shall learn whatever
is His Will.”
</p>
<p>It thus came about that, when the Prince made a landing, instead of finding those
he came to see in a state of panic, they were all drawn up in perfect order, and nothing,
save their eyes, gave the slightest sign that anything out of the way was taking place.
</p>
<p>As soon as the Prince stepped out of the carriage, however, the King knew him; for
the fame of his person and marvellous works had penetrated to the remotest parts of
Australia, and he would have been recognised anywhere. Without the slightest <span class="corr" id="xd31e829" title="Source: hestitation">hesitation</span>, therefore, the King stepped forward, offered his hand to his distinguished visitor,
and in the kindliest manner bade him welcome!
</p>
<p>Now it so happens that there are a very great number and variety of Wattle Fairies,
and they are to be found in practically all parts of Australia. But by general consent,
King Acacia and his wife, Queen Cootamundra, are recognised as being at the head of
all the tribes. They are an extraordinarily handsome couple; and all their children
are very lovely indeed, especially their eldest daughter, <span class="pageNum" id="pb62">[<a href="#pb62">62</a>]</span>Princess Wattle Blossom! As soon as Prince Waratah saw her he vowed to himself that
never in all his life had he seen anyone so gloriously beautiful and charming; for
the fact is, that not only is she delightfully sweet to gaze upon, but her manners
are so perfect as to make her at once the most kindly and the most gracious Princess
in the whole of Fairy Land. Her only fault, if such it can be called, is a tendency
to droop her head a little; but this is wholly due to a certain natural shyness, and
entirely disappears whenever she speaks or moves. It would have been strange indeed
if the Prince had not instantly fallen in love with her—as he did—and had not resolved
to some day make her his wedded wife. Nevertheless he paid her many, many visits before
the courtship ended, and the marriage actually took place.
</p>
<p>But to return to the Palace, about which you were being informed, when the Prince’s
desire for a wife somehow came into the story.
</p>
<p>Apart from the Entrance Hall, which has already been described, there are several
rooms that call for more than passing mention. For instance, there is the Laughter
Room! That may seem a strange name for a room, but the Prince has very decided opinions
on certain matters, and one of his fixed ideas is that, next to Sunshine, Laughter
is the finest thing in the World. He calls it “spiritual Sunshine,” because, he says,
whenever folks laugh, worry and trouble disappear just as quickly as clouds before
the sun itself. And so he urges that “everybody, every day, should take a little time
for play, to laugh and drive dull care away!” He also says that everybody should have
a laughter room in the house; by which he means, of course, that everyone should be
careful not to so engage themselves with serious matters, that in their whole make-up
there is no room for laughter. People like that, he thinks, do not enjoy life properly;
and in order that he and those associated with him might laugh at times, he specially
arranged for a Laughter Room.
</p>
<div class="figure p063width"><img src="images/p063.png" alt="“He vowed to himself that never in all his life had he seen anyone so gloriously beautiful and charming.”" width="594" height="720"><p class="figureHead">“He vowed to himself that never in all his life had he seen anyone so gloriously beautiful
and charming.”</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>Already, perhaps, you are wondering what sort of things that room contains? Well,
not for long does it remain the same! Changes are constantly taking place, for one
cannot continually laugh at the same old joke. But to give you an idea of the kind
of thing <span class="pageNum" id="pb65">[<a href="#pb65">65</a>]</span>the Prince thinks funny, here are several that have appeared in the room at one time
or another.
</p>
<p>Number One: A baby bear, up in a gum tree, has just started to nibble at a particularly
tempting leaf when over the edge of it peeps a Daddy Long Legs Spider, who says, “Excuse
me! But I know something that you don’t know!” “What’s that?” says the Bear, but without
letting go. “Why!” replies Daddy Long Legs, “You’re biting my foot!” “Sorry!” says
the Bear, letting go; “I hope I haven’t sprained your ankle,” and he laughs till the
tears run down his face.
</p>
<p>Number Two: A fat little Fairy boy, having fallen into the dust, picks himself up
and stands crying great big teardrops, that, as they run down his chest, look like
the snakes that children make with treacle on nice white slices of bread. Sitting
on a fence, watching what is going on, are two Kookaburras, resting a little after
having killed a big brown snake. When they see the funny little “Wrigglies,” running
down the Fairy boy’s chest, they burst into such fits of laughter, that they each,
so to speak, have to hold their sides, with the result that they both fall off the
fence head over heels into the dusty road; and then the boy laughs till he has to
sit down!
</p>
<p>Number Three: Placed between the forked branches of a tree sits a bird’s nest. In
it are three little bare-headed baby birds, eyeing in puzzled astonishment a big fat
grub that has fallen on the edge of the nest from somewhere overhead, and is doubling
away as fast as ever he can, saying as he goes: “Good-bye, Dearies! I’m so glad I
saw you! But don’t wait for me for dinner! I’ve simply got to go home at once! And,
by the way, don’t tell mother you saw me! It would make her feel sorry to think she
missed me!”
</p>
<p>Number Four: An old Mother Crow—all of whose children were as black as coal—was very
jealous of the beauty of the Lyre Bird. Hearing one day that the Stork was bringing
a nice new Baby to her hated rival, she placed around her neck a Lyre Bird’s tail
that she had stolen years before, and watched and waited for the Stork to pass, hoping
against hope that he would give her the baby Lyre-bird for herself. But when the Stork
came along he saw through the poor make-believe, and though he felt a little sorry
for the Crow, he <span class="pageNum" id="pb66">[<a href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>instantly resolved to punish her for stealing the Lyre Bird’s tail, as well as for
trying to deceive him! So instead of passing by, he stopped and said, “Hello, Crow!
Where did you get the Feather Stole?” And the silly Crow excitedly answered, “Stole
it! No, no! I don’t mean that! It’s not a stole at all; it’s a Ruff! But you shouldn’t
call me a ‘Crow’! I’m a Lyre Bird, and I’m waiting for the nice new baby you’ve got
in your basket.’ ” “… Oh! ho!” retorted the Stork, “you’re a Lyre Bird all right;
but,” he added, “I can’t give you the Lyre Bird baby I’ve got in the basket, because
it’s promised to somebody else. But,” said he, observing her disappointment, and with
a humorous glint in his eye, “if you hatch out the egg I’ll give you, you may get
a surprise!”
</p>
<p>Naturally enough, the Old Mother Crow, finding herself unable to deceive the Stork,
and fairly burning with curiosity to find out what the surprise might be, took the
egg and faithfully promised to sit on it until it was hatched out. And she kept her
word, too, sitting on it night and day, with the ruff round her neck in case she might
get a young Lyre Bird.
</p>
<p>After a number of days she suddenly felt something move, and jumping off her nest
in a state of great excitement, looked to see what she had got. To her intense mortification
and disgust, she saw nothing in the nest but an ugly young Iguana! She was so annoyed
at the trick that had been played upon her, that the tears sprang to her eyes, and
she was just about to give vent to her outraged feelings in an angry squawk, when
a number of yellow crested Cockatoos, sitting on a tree not far from her nest, seeing
what had happened, laughed so loudly and derisively, that the Crow flew from the spot
and was never seen again!
</p>
<p>The next of the Palace rooms to call for attention is known as the Music Room. In
it can be seen every instrument of Fairy music that has ever been invented. And very
odd some of them are, too; though they are all capable of giving forth the most tuneful
sounds imaginable. Among the many instruments are some so perfectly made that they
can imitate Canaries, Larks and Nightingales with an accuracy that is truly fine.
By simply touching a tiny spring the mechanism is released, and instantly one may
hear a flood of melody <span class="pageNum" id="pb67">[<a href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>that would cause a Lark, for instance, to believe that one of his fellows was singing
near! But the instrument which excites the greatest wonder of them all is called a
Melodophone! It is the outcome of so much patience and skill that by a little adjustment
it can be made to produce any kind of music—vocal or instrumental—from a single voice
singing the simplest melody, up to the grandest orchestral masterpieces. It really
is wonderful!
</p>
<p>The Prince is very proud of his music room, and takes an immense delight in demonstrating
what his collection of musical instruments can do. Further, he everywhere strongly
maintains that music is one of the finest aids to happiness. Longfellow, the American
poet, must have had much the same thought in his mind when he wrote that priceless
little poem, entitled “The Singers,” for he makes “The Great Master” say of “The Singers”:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“I gave a various gift to each,
</p>
<p class="line">To <i>charm</i>, to <i>strengthen</i>, and to <i>teach</i>,
</p>
<p class="line">These are the three great cords of might,
</p>
<p class="line">And he whose ear is tuned aright,
</p>
<p class="line">Will hear no discord in the three,
</p>
<p class="line">But the most perfect harmony!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In like manner, you will remember how the Prince, in connection with the long, long
march to the Magic Well, constantly encouraged his followers to sing the Marching
Song he had written for them. And how it cheered and strengthened them. Even when
they were almost ready to drop with fatigue, a little singing always seemed to take
away the tired feeling and put them in good humour again.
</p>
<p>Applying the same idea to matters of greater importance, he says that Music stirs
folks to think fine thoughts, prevents them from thinking bad ones, and helps to make
them happy. No happy person can possibly be wicked! It is the unhappy who say and
do the vile things! Knowing this to be the case, he has very wisely ordered that at
least two Bands shall play for his people every day—one in the Fountain Gardens and
one on the Lake.
</p>
<p>In addition, seeing that all Fairies are very fond of dancing, and that they always
dance in circles, he has also provided for them a <span class="pageNum" id="pb68">[<a href="#pb68">68</a>]</span>couple of Fairy Rings, where they may indulge in their favourite pastime as much and
as often as they please.
</p>
<p>Lastly, there are five story-tellers, who, although they once had very nice names—and
you may be told them later on—were long, long ago called “Touch,” “Taste,” “Sight,”
“Smell” and “Hearing,” and every day they have such interesting tales to tell that
no one who cares to hearken need ever be dull or depressed. So now you know why it
is that all the Prince’s people are so entirely happy and contented.
</p>
<p>Of the other rooms of the Palace not yet mentioned there is only time to describe
one more on this occasion. It is sometimes called “The Hall of the Captive Sunbeams”;
but in reality, it is the Reception Room—that is to say, it is the Room where guests
or visitors are received prior to being entertained at dinner, or at a musical evening,
or at whatever other form of entertainment is to be given them. The reason for its
being popularly named “The Hall of the Captive Sunbeams” is due to the fact that certain
portions of the Walls appear to radiate sunlight. This peculiar and striking effect
has been brought out by the use of tiles, set like pictures in frames of brightly
burnished silver. In the tiles themselves captured sunbeams shimmer and dance perpetually.
</p>
<p>How this was done is difficult to say; but the story goes that when making the tiles,
the Fairies set them where the Sun’s rays gently touched them every day; and, just
as the sun was declining, they each day swiftly brushed the fronts of the tiles with
a kind of liquid glaze that kept the light beneath it. When, in this way, several
thicknesses of light were captured, so to speak, the tiles were burned in specially
prepared kilns, and to the very great joy of the Fairy Craftsmen it was found, when
finished, that one sunbeam seemed to be for ever chasing another over and over the
face of the tiles! There is but one other notable feature about the “Hall of the Captive
Sunbeams”—it is that the more the place is filled with gaiety and laughter the more
merrily do the sunbeams seem to pour forth a running, rippling tide of light, to enhance
and stimulate the general jollity!
</p>
<p>And now you have some faint conception of the beauty and the glory of the Prince’s
Palace, some little idea of its furnishing for use <span class="pageNum" id="pb69">[<a href="#pb69">69</a>]</span>and entertainment, and, above all, some grasp of the outstanding features which make
it not only the most noticeable structure in the Fairy City, but of such unequalled
originality and excellence as to be without a rival anywhere.
</p>
<p>There it stands, a perfectly modelled two-storied white marble building surmounted
by a roof of reddish sunset gold. On its front is the nobly pillared verandah and
balcony; and setting it off, like a splendid frame to a valuable painting, are the
widespread and delightful garden grounds which entirely surround it.
</p>
<p>Seeing it thus, as you now see it in your mind’s eye, on the evening of a lovely Autumn
day very shortly after it was finished, Prince Waratah declared it perfect, save and
except in one particular: it lacked a worthy mistress. That, however, was an omission
which could be remedied; and as he had already made up his mind who was to be asked
to fill the position, he there and then began to consider the many things that must
be done before the happy event. So commenced the long series of careful preparations
which were to end in the most unique and entrancing experience of his life—his marriage
to the Princess Wattle Blossom!
</p>
<p>Of that marriage, and of all that took place in connection with it, you shall be fully
informed when time and circumstances permit. Meanwhile, please remember, that in the
Prince’s Palace of twenty-four rooms—one for each hour of the day—some are for work,
some are for pleasure, and some are for sleep! With you it is just the same! There
is a time for work, a time for pleasure, and a time for sleep—and it is sleep-time
now! And so—good-night! Good-night!! Good-night!!!

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In concluding the story of the Prince’s Palace a reference was made to the Prince’s
marriage, and a promise made that some day you should be told all about that happy
event, and of all that happened in connection with it.
</p>
<p>Well, listen!
</p>
<p>As you will remember, when the Palace was finished, the Prince pronounced it perfect
save in one particular; it lacked a Mistress! To remedy that defect he had made up
his mind to marry Princess Wattle Blossom; and in order that there might be no delay,
he immediately set out in his famous flying carriage to visit King Acacia—the head
of the Wattle Fairies—and ask for his eldest daughter’s hand in marriage.
</p>
<p>On his arrival, the King, as always, very graciously received him, for he liked him
greatly, and, when he had heard his request, very willingly consented to give his
daughter to the Prince provided she herself were agreeable.
</p>
<p>This condition the Prince very properly accepted; and as he felt that in the course
of his previous visits he had already made a favourable <span class="pageNum" id="pb72">[<a href="#pb72">72</a>]</span>impression, he had little doubt but that the lovely Princess Wattle Blossom would
agree to marry him. None the less, before presenting himself with the object of putting
the question to her, he very carefully saw to it that in every detail of his clothing
and personal appearance, he should look his very, very best. That, for Prince Waratah,
was not a difficult matter, for he was really uncommonly handsome. His short, curly,
red hair, fine face, and graceful figure would have made him a striking personality
anywhere; but when clothed in his dark green coat, rose pink vest, and <span class="corr" id="xd31e918" title="Source: while">white</span> silk knee breeches, he looked exactly what he was—a great and noble Prince.
</p>
<p>As for the Princess Wattle Blossom, surely someone must have given her a hint of the
Prince’s coming and of the question he was likely to ask, for never before had she
looked so lovely and sweet! Dressed in a trailing gown of grey-green silk, embroidered
and adorned with golden traceries in front, she modestly stood waiting his arrival,
her beautiful face suffused in blushes and smiles, whilst her golden hair, seeming
to have escaped its bounds, went sunning over her shoulders in a perfect cascade of
shimmering curls!
</p>
<p>The Prince was enchanted! So much so, that as he stooped to kiss her hand, he could
barely murmur his greeting. But it took him only an instant to recover himself, and
in a few minutes his ready wit and fascinating conversation held the Princess positively
spellbound. Never before had he ever mentioned the Palace to her; but now, with very
great art and even greater tact, he skilfully described its beauties, its particularly
fine setting in ideal garden grounds; its splendid rooms, and their unique furnishings;
and the charming views to be had from <span class="corr" id="xd31e924" title="Source: it">its</span> pillared balcony. So enraptured was the Princess with the picture that he drew, that
more than once she innocently ejaculated, “Oh, how I should love to live in such a
glorious home!”
</p>
<p>On the last occasion upon which she so spoke, the Prince, having finished his description,
tenderly took her hand in his and smilingly replied, “And so you may—on <i>one</i> condition!” And the Princess, instantly perceiving the position in which she had
unwittingly placed herself, archly answered back: “You mean that I must pay for the
privilege, I suppose!” “Yes,” retorted the prince, with rising ardour, “you must give
me what is worth to me more than all the World holds<span class="pageNum" id="pb73">[<a href="#pb73">73</a>]</span>—you must give me yourself! Will you marry me? Will you take me for your husband,
and be my own dear, dear wife?”
</p>
<p>And the Princess, who had loved him from the very first, answered, “Yes, My Prince,
for I love you truly, and will never cease to love you until the end of time!” Thus
the Princess Wattle Blossom became the Prince’s promised bride; and from that day
forth, many were the preparations made for the wedding.
</p>
<p>Now the Prince had stipulated, that contrary to usual custom, the wedding was to take
place, not at the home of the bride’s parents, but at the Palace. This, he explained,
was in order that King Acacia, Queen Cootamundra, and as many of their relatives and
friends as cared to accept the invitation, might not only see the future home of the
bride, but the Fairy City itself—that wonderland of Fairyland about which they had
all heard something more or less fascinating and attractive.
</p>
<p>In consequence of this arrangement, what may be termed the “Cards of Invitation,”
were issued by the Prince. They were enclosed in a woven envelope made of the very
finest green rushes, and they consisted of two broad eucalyptus leaves fastened together
with twisted cords of spiders’ silk. On the outside of the first leaf was painted
the Prince’s Crest; a red Waratah rising above two green leaves of the plant on which
it blooms. On the face of these leaves, in letters of gold, his motto was written,
“I live to serve!” On the inside of the second leaf the actual invitation to the wedding
appeared. It, also, was written in golden letters. The wording of the invitation was
very brief, however, for the Fairies, like the ancients, generally use but few words
to express themselves.
</p>
<p>In this respect they are not unlike the early peoples, who, away back at the beginning
of things—long before writing was invented, only spoke nouns or names. Verbs, adverbs
and prepositions have all been added since. But it is a singular fact that the words
then used are at once the most expressive, the most simple and the most beautiful
in the language. Moreover, they are all words of one syllable! Earth, Air, Sea, Sky,
Light, Cold, Heat, Sun, Moon, Day, Night, Man, God! Another remarkable thing about
these words is that they all make an appeal to one or more of the five senses. For
this reason it <span class="pageNum" id="pb74">[<a href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>is not possible to “explain” them; the only way in which they can be comprehended
or understood is by private personal experience. Thus, no one can possibly understand
what light is except by seeing it, or heat or cold except by feeling it. Similarly,
without the sense of taste, sweet or sour has no meaning, and in like manner only
those who can hear know what music is, and only those who have a sense of smell are
able to enjoy the perfume of a flower.
</p>
<p>To return to the point, however, the “Cards of Invitation” were all sent out on the
same day—a hundred or two. They were taken to those for whom they were intended by
a truly splendid lot of Bronze-wing pigeons.
</p>
<p>The Fairies can teach birds to do nearly anything, and these beautiful Bronze-wing
pigeons were constantly used in much the same way as people use Carrier Pigeons to
take messages from place to place.
</p>
<p>In this case, instead of wrapping the message round the bird’s-leg, the envelope containing
the card was strung like a lady’s purse around the Bronze-wing pigeon’s neck.
</p>
<p>When they were all ready, it was a really charming sight to see them rise, and, wheeling
in the air, break into four groups, that, with the swiftness of light, sped away North,
East, West and South, until they were all lost to view.
</p>
<p>When they returned they brought the answers with them; and, as the Prince had expected,
the refusals were very few. This was partly due to the fact that with each invitation
a letter was forwarded saying that, if it were accepted, a flying-carriage would be
sent to bring the acceptors to the wedding and to take them home again. The possibility
of enjoying so novel a method of travel was in itself an inducement to accept; though
the vast majority were equally anxious to learn something of the Magic Well, or the
Fairy City, about both of which they had heard so many thrilling accounts.
</p>
<p>The reason why the Prince was able to promise them all the use of flying carriages
was because he had had his engineers at work upon quite a number ever since his own
was made, and, as the result of many experiments, it had been found possible to make
a carriage that would carry three, two in addition to a driver. They were not as <span class="pageNum" id="pb75">[<a href="#pb75">75</a>]</span>fast as the single seaters, but they were quite safe, and with Fairies trained to
drive them—Magpie teams for daylight travelling, and Owl teams for night-work—there
really was no danger whatever!
</p>
<p>After all the answers had been received, and the Prince knew exactly how many guests
to expect, he himself gave instructions to the Palace Cooks to prepare a gorgeous
wedding feast. There was to be no stint of anything, and everything was to be carried
out in the finest style known to the Chefs. Fruits and sweetmeats, and dainties and
delicacies of every class and kind under the sun were ordered to be got ready for
the “great day.” Flowers too! The rarest orchids and the most delicately perfumed
blossoms; golden wattle in particular! Music also! The sweetest strains the Fairy
Bands knew how to play; soft, engaging airs such as a bride <i>should</i> hear on the most eventful day of her life. In short, everything that could be thought
of to please, amuse and gratify the wedding guests, was, by the express orders of
the Prince, either at once obtained, or the necessary steps taken to see that it would
be ready on the Wedding Day!
</p>
<p>And when, at last, the day arrived, the excitement in and around the Fairy City was
simply intense.
</p>
<p>The day before, in the morning, came the Prince’s Father and Mother, King Eucalyptus
and Queen Fici-folia, together with their officers and attendants. It was said that
the Prince had been given his good looks by his lovely mother; she whose superb figure
and soft red hair were the pride of all the Eucalypts! They came thus early in order
to be ready, on behalf of the Prince, to receive and welcome all his guests.
</p>
<p>To them were given apartments in the Eastern side of the Palace.
</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the same day came King Acacia, Queen Cootamundra, Princess Wattle
Blossom and her sisters, and several officers and attendants of their household. They
had been asked to come the day before the wedding to enable the Princess to be thoroughly
rested and refreshed prior to the ceremony.
</p>
<p>To them was assigned a suite of rooms in the Western side of the Palace.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb76">[<a href="#pb76">76</a>]</span></p>
<p>For some of the officers of both the Royal Households, as well as for those who, coming
from a great distance, could not return the same day, special sleeping rooms had been
erected in the Palace Gardens.
</p>
<p>At this stage it has to be mentioned, that in addition to their other improvements,
all the Prince’s newest flying carriages were fitted with fairy wireless. This enabled
any of the drivers to send a message to the Prince whenever it was necessary so to
do. And it was indeed fortunate that such was the case, for although it had been arranged
that the Princess Wattle Blossom was to arrive the day before the wedding, within
about half an hour of the time that she was to have landed, something happened which
nearly prevented her from ever reaching the Fairy City at all.
</p>
<p>To properly understand the story of what occurred, it is necessary to go back a little,
and to remember that the malicious Desert Fairies had been twice defeated—once, when
they had attacked the Prince and his followers whilst on their way to the Magic Well;
and once, when they had tried to stop the making of the Lake which now encircles Fairy
Island. They were very sore at having been thwarted in their spiteful efforts, and
had resolved that if ever they got a chance, they would be revenged upon the Prince
in consequence. Thus, though they were very secret about it, they were always on the
lookout to do him harm.
</p>
<p>For a very long time, nothing took place which gave them the slightest opening to
put their wicked wishes into play. Then, by the merest accident, they learned that
Prince Waratah was about to be married, and “putting two and two together,” they made
up their minds to steal the Princess Wattle Blossom, and so rob him of his intended
wife. And strange as it may seem, had it not been that the carriage in which she was
travelling had its fairy wireless set in working order, the plot they laid would certainly
have succeeded. Even as it was, her adventure was an exciting one; and, while it lasted,
very, very trying.
</p>
<p>How the Desert Fairies came to find out that the Prince was about to be married, was,
to say the least of it, somewhat peculiar.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb77">[<a href="#pb77">77</a>]</span></p>
<p>One of the bronze-wing pigeons, carrying an invitation to a relative of the Prince’s
Mother, who lived in Western Australia, had almost flown across the desert, when,
to his horror, high above his head he saw the outstretched hovering form of a great
golden eagle. Instantly he knew that he would be killed, but true to his trust, he
slipped the invitation over his head, and letting it fall to the ground in the hope
that it would be found and forwarded by another messenger, sped ahead as fast as his
weary wings would bear him.
</p>
<p>But in point of speed, even the freshest, swiftest bronze-wing pigeon is very slow
compared with the mighty onrush of a powerful eagle, and almost before the Prince’s
bird had time to try and escape, the eagle dropped upon his back, and with one stroke
of his curved and cruel beak, struck the pigeon dead, and holding him in his strong
talons, sped away and away until he was entirely lost to sight.
</p>
<p>Now the card of invitation which the bronze-wing pigeon had let fall was picked up
by a passing Desert Fairy. He immediately took it to the head of the tribe, who forthwith
called his followers about him to consider the news. Having gained such an important
piece of information as the invitation disclosed, they were put upon their metal to
discover everything else about the marriage that it was possible to learn. By dint
of much spying and listening they at last got to know the whole of the details. They
thereupon decided to waylay the Princess on her journey to the Fairy City, and by
all the means at their command, beat down whatever escort was provided, and carry
her away.
</p>
<p>In some respects they were luckier than they could have expected to be. Their great
difficulty was how to bring the flying-carriage to the ground; for if they could not
stop it, they could not capture the Princess.
</p>
<p>After a good deal of hard thinking, they finally decided to station a certain number
of their members at different points along the route, somewhere near the places at
which it was believed the birds that drew the carriages would have to stop and rest.
</p>
<p>As it chanced, at the third stopping place, the carriage that contained the Princess
and her father King Acacia, had somehow become separated from the others which were
carrying Queen Cootamundra <span class="pageNum" id="pb78">[<a href="#pb78">78</a>]</span>and her daughters. This was an opportunity not to be missed, and in order to prevent
the carriage from again rising into the air, they tried to blind the driver with little
gusts of gritty sand. Had they succeeded in doing this, it was their intention to
rush in, seize the Princess Wattle Blossom, and compel her to go with them. But the
driver was happily able to defeat them in their object by using a fine silk handkerchief
to protect his eyes and face.
</p>
<p>Finding themselves foiled in this endeavour, they then sought to overset the carriage
by bringing up a blustery wind to rush against it from the side. Again they failed.
Hastily changing their tactics, just as the carriage was rising into the air, they
sent the wind beneath it in a wild attempt to tip it over on its face; but as before,
their efforts proved resultless. Very much disheartened, there was nothing left for
them to do but to sulkily stand and watch the flying carriage speeding on its way.
</p>
<p>From this time onward, everything would have gone well but for something which the
Princess asked the driver to do. They were then within about half an hour of the Fairy
City, and getting along famously. All at once the Princess espied a sight the like
of which she had never seen before. Looking down upon the earth she saw amid the dreary
wastes of sand a splendid patch of green plentifully splashed with red. Rather excitedly
calling the driver’s attention to it, she asked him to descend in order that she might
examine it more closely. This he did, stopping right beside a very large number of
plants that are known as Sturt’s Desert Pea, all in a flaming riot of glorious blossoms.
The Princess was enchanted; and very incautiously stepping out of the carriage, she
delightedly proceeded to gather an armful of the truly beautiful flowers.
</p>
<div class="figure p079width" id="p079"><img src="images/p079.jpg" alt="“They suddenly rushed from their hiding places and started pushing and dragging her over the sandy desert.”" width="596" height="720"><p class="figureHead">“They suddenly rushed from their hiding places and started pushing and dragging her
over the sandy desert.”</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>Meantime, quite a number of the vicious Desert Fairies, hoping that some such thing
would happen, had hidden themselves among the plants. As they hate the Garden Fairies
and all their works, it was their intention to destroy the blossoms in any case; but
believing that they would prove attractive to the Princess, they simply bided their
time. Seeing her walking along the edge of the desert peas, absorbed in picking the
deep red clustering blooms, they suddenly rushed out from their hiding places, seized
her by the hands and arms, <span class="pageNum" id="pb81">[<a href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>and started pushing and dragging her over the sandy desert. Her startled cries awoke
her father, who, tired with travelling, had fallen asleep in his seat. The driver
did not need to be wakened. Watching the Princess plucking the flowers, he had seen
what had taken place. In a flash he realised the danger she was in, and without an
instant’s hesitation he sent an S.O.S. message to the Prince at Fairy Island. And
it was well that he did; for the very next moment, some of the Desert Fairies who
had been left behind to prevent him going to the assistance of the Princess, dashed
a swirling, blinding cloud of dust full into his face. They then retreated as fast
as they could, throwing up a regular wall of sand and dust behind them as they went.
This device prevented the driver from seeing in which direction the Princess was being
taken, and left him almost helpless.
</p>
<p>To make matters worse, when King Acacia realised that the Princess was being stolen,
he was almost distracted, and nothing the driver could say or do made any impression
on his mind. He was so distraught, so full of anger, that he appeared to be unable
to listen, and stamped up and down in utter helplessness.
</p>
<p>The driver tried to get him back into the carriage so that they might at least follow
and attempt to rescue his daughter. But it was all to no purpose; and as he dared
not leave the King behind, he also was compelled to remain inactive and to do nothing.
And all the time, despite her pitiful struggles, the Princess was being taken further
and further away. The situation was indeed desperate, and it wrung the driver’s heart
to think that like a ninny he must stand about in stupid idleness. Oh, how he prayed
that the message he had sent the Prince might safely reach him!
</p>
<p>Very fortunately it did! And still more fortunately, the Prince had contemplated going
out to meet the Princess and her father as they neared the City, and so was ready
with his famous team of blue kingfishers to make an immediate start. Pausing only
to give instructions for a band of Shower Fairies to follow after him as hard as they
could, he leaped into his flying-carriage, and almost in the twinkling of an eye,
was off to save the Princess from an awful fate.
</p>
<p>If ever the Kingfishers put forth their best speed they did it that afternoon. So
swiftly did they fly that within twenty minutes after <span class="pageNum" id="pb82">[<a href="#pb82">82</a>]</span>he had received the wireless message, Prince Waratah, flying high above the dust,
had sighted the Princess and her kidnappers, and was bearing down upon the group with
the swiftness of a shooting star.
</p>
<p>Howling with rage and disappointment, the Desert Fairies loosed a tearing wind against
the Prince, and filling the air with sand and dust, and even little pebbles, desperately
strove to prevent him getting near them. But what cared the Prince for such an attack!
Urging his obedient Kingfishers upward, he shot over the top of the flying dust and
sand, and dashing downward with amazing speed, sprang out of his carriage and rushed
upon his foes. Craven cowards that they are, they fled before him in all directions,
just as the Shower Fairies, rapidly following after the Prince, sent their pelting
raindrops hurtling after them.
</p>
<p>Very, very timely was the Shower Fairies’ aid, and the Prince was very grateful for
it.
</p>
<p>Tenderly lifting the exhausted Princess in his arms he bore her to his carriage; and
taking out a little phial of cordial, mixed it with some water from the Magic Well,
and giving it to her to drink, in a minute or two she was her smiling self again.
</p>
<p>She then told him how she had come to be captured. It was because she had, unthinkingly,
left the carriage to get some flowers. Now, strewn about the desert over which she
had been dragged, they all lay dead!
</p>
<p>The Prince at once resolved that she should have some others to take their place.
After resting a little while, they, therefore, returned to the spot where they could
be obtained, and the Prince himself gathered her a giant posy. Then, seating her beside
her father in the carriage in which she had been travelling, he placed the lovely
blossoms in her arms, contriving as he did so, to kiss the dainty hand that on the
morrow was to be given him in marriage.
</p>
<p>On the wedding morning, from quite an early hour, the sky was filled with flying carriages
bringing in the guests.
</p>
<p>Perhaps you can imagine the curiosity and wonder with which the arrival of each newcomer
was viewed by the Fairy Folk. No doubt the deportment and demeanour of all were silently
admired or criticised; whilst the mere novelty of seeing distinguished personages
<span class="pageNum" id="pb83">[<a href="#pb83">83</a>]</span>whom they had never seen before must have been considered quite a treat!
</p>
<p>By noon, however, the last of the wedding guests had arrived, and all were happily
preparing for the ceremony, which was timed to take place at four o’clock precisely.
</p>
<p>The ceremony arrangements were of the simplest character. On a raised platform reached
by steps, beneath a spreading blackwood tree, in the middle of a velvety green lawn,
stood the “Official Recorder,” he who causes to be recorded everything that must be
kept in what are called the “Archives”; in other words, the place in which public
records and historic documents are safely stored.
</p>
<p>A little behind him, at a table, sat his clerk, ready to write down in letters of
gold on this occasion, an official record of whatever was said or done.
</p>
<p>At the right hand side of the “Official Recorder,” stood Prince Waratah and his “First
Friend,” Prince Floral—the last remaining member of the Royal House of the Garden
Fairies. It was a very nice thought on the part of Prince Waratah to have for his
“best man,” so to speak, the somewhat lonely but lovable Prince of the scattered Garden
Fairies, and when it became known that this was to be the case, there was not a Garden
Fairy throughout the whole of Australia who did not feel a thrill of pride and joy
in consequence!
</p>
<p>Facing the “Official Recorder,” to the right and left, in two great triangles, sat
the wedding guests. There was thus formed a middle pathway up which the Bridal Party
was to come at the appointed hour. Whilst waiting for that auspicious moment all were
interested to note the singular grace and beauty of the two noble Princes.
</p>
<p>The Bridegroom, Prince Waratah, was naturally the first to come under observation.
Taller than the average, his face aglow with animation and happiness, he was in truth
a striking figure. He was superbly dressed! Upon his head—above the curls of glossy
red it did not try to hide—he wore a golden coloured cap, from which there rose a
splendid feather of the very shade that matched his hair. His coat was of a glossy
green colour; the collar, edges and pockets being trimmed with a broad band of golden
embroidery. At his throat and <span class="pageNum" id="pb84">[<a href="#pb84">84</a>]</span>wrists he wore the most beautiful white lace. His vest was of a rich yellow; and his
knee-breeches and stockings were of delicate white. On his feet were shoes of the
same colour as his vest; whilst his garters were of a deep-sea blue, fastened with
diamond clasps!
</p>
<p>Prince Floral was similarly attired as far as style was concerned, except that his
coat was the colour of golden brown wall flowers, and his vest a perfect pink.
</p>
<p>When the Bride appeared, leaning on her father’s arm, it was seen that her dress was
of the purest white silk, into which was worked in golden thread, the daintiest sprays
of Golden Wattle. And very lovely did she look, her face suffusing with blushes as
she felt the gaze of so many pairs of eyes.
</p>
<p>Two of her sisters were in attendance as “First Ladies,” or Bridesmaids. And they,
too, were very beautiful in their dresses of hydrangea-blue, decorated and adorned
with sashes and knots of faintest pink.
</p>
<p>On their arrival at the platform, Prince Waratah stepped swiftly down, and, taking
the Princess by the hand, together they mounted the steps and stood before the “Official
Recorder.” In a clear, ringing voice the Prince then said to that Officer: “I, Prince
Waratah, desire you to note that I, here and now, take the Princess Wattle Blossom,
to be my wife!” The Princess immediately added: “And I, Princess Wattle Blossom, desire
you to note, that I, here and now, take the Prince Waratah to be my husband and my
Lord.” They both then turned towards the assembled guests, and the “Official Recorder,”
standing a little to one side, raised his voice, and said, “Be it known that, before
me, this day, the Prince Waratah and the Princess Wattle Blossom, have become husband
and wife. So be it! Praise be to God!” And so, amidst a burst of acclamation and applause,
the wedding ceremony ended!
</p>
<div class="figure p085width" id="p085"><img src="images/p085.jpg" alt="“Together they mounted the steps and stood before the ‘Official Recorder.’”" width="599" height="720"><p class="figureHead">“Together they mounted the steps and stood before the ‘Official Recorder.’ ”</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>Then followed a long, long series of congratulations and good wishes ere it was possible
to adjourn to the great dining-room in which the wedding feast was spread. It must
have been quite six o’clock before everyone was in place. Any observant person, looking
round the room, would then have noted a curious fact. The number seated at every table
except the one at which the Bride and Bridegroom <span class="pageNum" id="pb87">[<a href="#pb87">87</a>]</span>sat, was exactly seven. At the chief table there were nine. This arrangement was in
no wise accidental. In point of fact it was done deliberately, the Fairies, like the
ancient peoples, having the greatest regard and respect for numbers and their meanings.
To them, three is the perfect number—and three multiplied by three, which is nine,
the limit to which perfection can go. Never at any time therefore do they seat together
more than nine; and then only when they are very distinguished persons indeed. In
like manner they look upon seven as God’s own number; the one that means rest after
labour; for, as you will remember, in six days God made Heaven and Earth, and on the
seventh day He rested. Furthermore, they know that just as in the Alphabet, A, B and
C, contain the lines and curves of all the other letters, so in ordinary numbers,
1, 2 and 3, contain all the lines and curves of all the others. But what impresses
them most are the following two remarkable facts. Firstly, if you double over the
first three numbers, you cover up 4, 5 and 6, and arrive at 7, the perfect number,
the one that in itself holds the lines and curves of all the others! Secondly, if
you double over the first three letters of the Alphabet you cover up D E F, and arrive
at G, the seventh letter, the perfect letter that in itself embraces the lines and
curves of all the others—the initial letter of the mightiest name in the Universe:
its Creator, God!
</p>
<p>The Fairies, however, were so used to being seated in the way described, and so understood
the reason for it, that in effect they took no notice; but gave themselves up to the
full enjoyment of the splendid fare provided for them.
</p>
<p>After they had partaken of as much as they desired, the Prince, always alert, nodded
his head to the waiting attendants, and in less time than it takes to tell it, the
tables were cleared, and there began the various entertainments that were to grace
the evening.
</p>
<p>First, the Band, which played a most engaging selection of soft harmonious airs, sweet
enough to have made the stars of Heaven brighten could they have heard them. Then
came the first of the “Five Story Tellers”—the most popular persons in Fairyland.
</p>
<p>These Story Tellers, who need never lack an audience, are the most ancient of all
the Fairies—so old (though they do not look it) <span class="pageNum" id="pb88">[<a href="#pb88">88</a>]</span>that they seem to have existed ever since the World began. What they were first called,
no one now remembers. Some think they once had names which meant Faith, Love, Truth,
Knowledge and Art; but be that as it may, to-day they are called “Touch,” “Taste,”
“Sight,” “Smell,” and “Hearing.” Whenever they tell a story they always begin it in
the same way. First they give the title of the tale, and then, as in all Fairy Stories,
they say: “Once upon a time, a long while ago,” such and such a thing happened. So,
when “Touch” began his Tale, he being first to be asked, this is what he said:—
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="ch5" class="div1 chapter"><span class="pageNum">[<a href="#xd31e240">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">THE SKYLARK’S STORY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Once upon a time, a long while ago, I was passing over a field. Pausing for a moment
to look at a flower, a Lark fell palpitating at my feet, hot and weary with singing.
Taking him up in my left hand, whilst I gently fanned him with my right, I said, ‘Tell
me, Lark, what is your story, and why do you sing?’ And when he was cool again, this
is the tale he told:—
</p>
<p>“ ‘Once I was an egg, and I lay in a tiny nest among the grasses of the field. The
shell, within which I lived, was very small and somewhat dark, but warm! Occasionally,
however, I could see just a little glimpse of light; and now and then I could indistinctly
hear my father talking or singing to my mother. But I couldn’t move, and I couldn’t
speak.
</p>
<p>“ ‘Then came a day when I thought I heard an awful crash. It was so loud and thunderous
that it seemed to me as if the sky had fallen. At the time it happened I was almost
asleep, I think, for I appeared to have waked with such a sudden start, that I pushed
my beak <span class="corr" id="xd31e1042" title="Source: cleaned">clean</span> through the shell in which I lived; broke it in half; and there I sat, blinking and
winking at the sunlight in the most stupid manner conceivable.
</p>
<p>“ ‘In a minute or two I saw my mother! She was looking down at me as proudly as if
I were an eagle instead of a wee little lark—almost naked, and so weak, that I couldn’t
stand up, no matter how hard I tried. In fact, every time I tried, I fell back so
funnily that my mother laughed a little, and that made me cry!
<span class="pageNum" id="pb89">[<a href="#pb89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p089width"><img src="images/p089.png" alt="Touch tells a story." width="602" height="720"><p class="figureHead">Touch tells a story.</p>
</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb91">[<a href="#pb91">91</a>]</span></p>
<p>“ ‘When she saw me crying she said: “Never mind, little one! You’ll soon do much more
than stand up—you’ll fly! And now just lie down until I go and get you your breakfast!”
and off she flew! My word, she <i>was</i> quick! I hardly seemed to have lain down before she was back with it—the queerest
little pinky-red wriggly thing you ever saw in your life; but so soft and juicy looking
that, when she put it on my tongue, I just popped it down my throat and gave a little
squeak for more!
</p>
<p>“ ‘But that’s a long while ago!
</p>
<p>“ ‘As I grew and got some feathers, my mother taught me first to walk a little, then
to run, and finally to fly! Very well do I remember my first little flight. I could
scarcely have gone a dozen yards, when down I came plop! right on my mother’s back!
How she got beneath me, goodness only knows! But it was a good thing for me that she
did, for when I saw where I should have fallen; it was right on top of an old spiky
post in a fence—and I certainly would have been hurt.
</p>
<p>“ ‘One day my father came to me and said: “Up you come with me, little laddie! You’re
old enough now to get into the air, and to get your first singing lesson!”
</p>
<p>“ ‘I fairly worshipped my father! He really was wonderful, for on all the days when
my mother was feeding me or teaching me to fly, we could just see him away up overhead,
singing rapturously.
</p>
<p>“ ‘And the songs he sang! The notes came raining down like dew-drops, diamonds, rubies,
sapphires. They were made of sunshine, jewels, and running water! You never heard
the like of them! And my mother, who loved him to distraction, would often stop in
her teaching and just gaze up at him as if he were an angel!
</p>
<p>“ ‘But, as I was saying, my father came to me for my first skyward lesson. How I loved
it! Round and up, and up and round we went, until we appeared to be miles and miles
above the earth!
</p>
<p>“ ‘And, looking about me, at the sun, the sky, and the good green earth, all at once
I knew what everything meant, and almost without knowing it, I opened my throat and
sang till I dropped!
</p>
<p>“ ‘Very fortunately my father, who probably guessed what would happen, was watching
closely, and the very instant that my wings <span class="pageNum" id="pb92">[<a href="#pb92">92</a>]</span>gave way he caught me on his back, and down we came in the most graceful spirals you
ever saw! Day after day we did the same thing, until at last, strong of wing, and
mellow throated as my father, he gave me the right to soar and sing whenever I pleased!
</p>
<p>“ ‘As to why I sing, I can only say that everything in the World seems so good, so
lovely and so bright, that I cannot help it. Besides, I love to hear my own voice,
it is so sweet. And I rather think that the Angels of Heaven, looking down as I often
do at this beautiful earth, must find it not only easy to sing, but must simply long
for the time when they can come and teach their songs to human beings,—just as my
father taught me his!’ ”
</p>
<p>So concluded the story.
</p>
<p>Then someone sang a Fairy song, and everybody joined in the chorus.
</p>
<p>After that the Prince asked one of the Couriers—one of those who are sent out with
important letters—to repeat something he once heard at a concert. And this is what
the Courier said:—
</p>
<p>“Once upon a time, a long while ago, I stopped to listen to a children’s concert,

<p>When they were quite quiet again, “Taste,” the second of the Five Story Tellers, began
his tale as follows:—

<div id="ch7" class="div1 chapter"><span class="pageNum">[<a href="#xd31e252">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">THE GRAPE VINE’S STORY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Once upon a time, a long while ago, faint and weary from the heat of the day, I sheltered
myself under a shady vine. When I looked up I saw beautiful bunches of grapes—like
ladies’ fingers—hanging all about me. A bunch I took, and found them so delicious
that I said to the vine, ‘Tell me, Grape Vine, what is your story, and why do you
grow such grapes?’ And this is what the Grape Vine said:—
</p>
<p>“ ‘My story is a very simple one! When I was a little hard white pip I was covered
with pale, firm flesh, and my green skin was as smooth as silk! As I grew older my
flesh got softer, and my skin expanded to allow for my growth.
</p>
<p>“ ‘About this time the Sun began to take notice of me; and in a playful way he took
to patting my cheeks every time he passed. In <span class="pageNum" id="pb95">[<a href="#pb95">95</a>]</span>spite of myself I always blushed; and, somehow, try as I might, I never could get
rid of the blush again. The result was, that the oftener I blushed the deeper my colour
became.
</p>
<p>“ ‘One day he stopped to tease me about it, and I got so annoyed that I became almost
red with indignation. At that very moment, a pretty little lady, passing by, evidently
seeing my plight, promptly plucked me from my place and popped me in her mouth! For
a moment or two I was pleased to be out of the sight of the Sun; but presently I got
so warm that I was glad to be taken out, even if it was only to be stared at by my
tiny lady friend!
</p>
<p>“ ‘It was then that I had time to notice that she had lovely blue eyes, milk-white
teeth, and the prettiest little fingers in the world! “Poor little grape,” said she;
“I don’t suppose you know I’m going to eat you; but I am! What a pity you are so round
and red! I wonder why you don’t grow as long as my finger? You would be far prettier
if you were shaped like a lady’s finger instead of like an owl’s eye!”
</p>
<p>“ ‘And she laughed so suddenly that I nearly fell out of her hand with fright!
</p>
<p>“ ‘Now, although she said that funny thing about me, I was so charmed with the way
in which she spoke, that I there and then resolved, if ever I got the chance, to try
and grow in the shape she had suggested.
</p>
<p>“ ‘But an instant after I thought that the end of the world had come, for, with a
smart little nip of her teeth she cut right into my flesh, and in less than a minute
she had stripped me bare, and I lay in the palm of her hand, nearly frightened to
death!
</p>
<p>“ ‘ “Poor little seed,” she murmured, looking down at me strangely, “I wonder if you
know what has happened to you, and whether you’ve got any life left! Well, <i>you</i> can’t say, and <i>I</i> don’t know!” And with that she blew me off the palm of her hand into the soft brown
earth of her father’s orchard!
</p>
<p>“ ‘There I lay for many a day, waiting for something, though what it was I couldn’t
understand.
</p>
<p>“ ‘By-and-by the winter rains began to fall, and the soil about me tightened its grip.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb96">[<a href="#pb96">96</a>]</span></p>
<p>“ ‘At first I didn’t like it; but I soon found out that if I wanted to be cosy and
warm I had better not wriggle and struggle, as at first I felt inclined. Oh, how good
and kind I found the Earth to be! For quite a long time she let me sleep, and when
it was time to wake she softly whispered: “Feet down! Head up! Head up! Feet down!”
And almost without knowing what I was doing, I felt myself pressing downwards with
two little legs, and pushing upwards with a little green head as hard as ever I could.
</p>
<p>“ ‘The moment I got my head through the soil I knew that I had done the right thing!
There was the orchard I knew so well, and there, too, the Sun, who somehow seemed
different, for instead of patting me on the cheeks as he used to do, he kept on saying,
“Come up! Climb! Climb! If you want to get on in the world you must climb!”
</p>
<p>“ ‘Well, as it seemed the right thing to do, climb I did; and I kept on climbing,
until one day my little lady’s father stopped to examine me.
</p>
<p>“ ‘ “Oh, ho!” said Mr. Orchardist, “what have we here? A good-looker right enough!
I must watch you grow, my lady!”
</p>
<p>“ ‘And he did too, giving me regular attention, treatment and care, until I began
to feel that the deepest wish of my heart would be gratified. And sure enough it was,
for in my fourth year, much to my little lady’s delight, I began to grow a grape she
had never seen before—a long and shapely grape, with just the daintiest pink flesh
on its delicate skin!
</p>
<p>“ ‘Quite unknown to her, Mr. Orchardist had also seen what was taking place, and one
day, to my intense joy, he said to the little lady, “Come hither, little lady, and
show me your hand!” And as she held it out, he dropped into it my first bunch of grapes,
saying, as he did so: “At last! At long last! Here are My Lady’s Fingers!”
</p>
<p>“ ‘As to why I grow such grapes there is surely no need to say. It is to perpetuate
the memory of the sweet little lady on whose hand I saw the fingers which inspired
me to imitate their dainty shape.’ ”
</p>
<p>So ended the story.
</p>
<p>There followed a second selection by the Band; after which the Prince announced that
a “Storks’ Companion”—one of the Fairies <span class="pageNum" id="pb97">[<a href="#pb97">97</a>]</span>who goes with a Stork when he takes a new baby home—would say what he overheard on
one well remembered occasion.
</p>

<h2 class="main">WHEN THE STORK CALLED</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Once upon a time, a long while ago, I went with a Stork to deliver a new baby. Next
morning, the Nurse told the baby’s father and some friends who had called, all about
it. And this is what she said:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">‘The Boy’ and ‘The Girl’ were both abed,
</p>
<p class="line">Their prayers were said;
</p>
<p class="line">And each little curly silken head
</p>
<p class="line">Was laid on its own downy pillow!
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">When, sakes alive!
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Like bees from a hive,
</p>
<p class="line">With a buzz and a boom that seemed to run
</p>
<p class="line">From the earth to the sea, and from there to the sun,
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">There came such a knock!
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Such a sharp rat-tat!
</p>
<p class="line">That the boy woke up and said, ‘What’s that?’
</p>
<p class="line">And the girl from her bed jumped out on her hat!
</p>
<p class="line">(A ridiculous place, you must all agree,
</p>
<p class="line">On the bedroom floor for a hat to be!)
</p>
<p class="line">And all the while, that rapid rat-tat,
</p>
<p class="line">Made their little hearts beat ‘a-pity-poor-pat!’
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Then the queerest of sounds
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">On their quick ears fell!
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">It was not a cry;
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">And ’twas hardly a yell!
</p>
<p class="line">But they both felt sure, as they sat so still,
</p>
<p class="line">’Twas the Stork had knocked with his hard long bill!
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">But oh, it was an aching time!
</p>
<p class="line">The Hall clock <i>twice</i> rang out its chime
</p>
<p class="line">Ere Grandma came, and to them told,
</p>
<p class="line">How the Stork had come through the night so cold!
<span class="pageNum" id="pb98">[<a href="#pb98">98</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Had called and said,
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">As they lay abed—

<p class="line">‘Here’s the baby for which you prayed!

<p class="line xd31e1221">Then, like a star

<p class="line xd31e1221">That shoots afar;

<p class="line">Away he flew on pinions light,

<p class="line">Right away on aery wing,

<p class="line">On to where the Babies wait,

<p class="line">Just beside God’s Golden Gate!”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Everybody seemed to be pleased with the effort of the “Storks’ Companion”; but not
to have a break in the night’s proceedings, “Sight,” the third of “The Five Story
Tellers,” was called upon to tell a tale.
</p>
<p>And this is what he said:—

<h2 class="main">THE RAINDROP’S STORY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Once upon a time, a long while ago, I stood upon a hill-top, watching the rain clouds
drifting past. Suddenly a raindrop fell into the palm of my outstretched hand, and
lay there looking at me! He was so clear and cool, so bright-eyed and so fearless,
that I said to him: ‘Tell me, Raindrop, what is your story, and why do you fall?’
</p>
<p>“And this is the tale he told:—
</p>
<p>“ ‘When I was very young, and very, <i>very</i> tiny, I lay upon the bosom of my mother, the Ocean. And many a time when I was inclined
to be fretful, because the wind ruffled my spray-like hair, she gently rocked me off
to sleep.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb99">[<a href="#pb99">99</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p099width"><img src="images/p099.png" alt="A RAIN FAIRY." width="521" height="720"><p class="figureHead">A RAIN FAIRY.</p>
</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb101">[<a href="#pb101">101</a>]</span></p>
<p>“ ‘Then came a day when the sun held out his hands and arms to me in such a winning
fashion, that before I knew what he was doing, he had lifted me up and placed me in
the downy folds of a fleecy cloud.
</p>
<p>“ ‘At first I felt a little frightened, especially when I peeped down at the great
big moving world beneath.
</p>
<p>“ ‘But very soon I perceived that there were quite a number of us being carried by
the cloud, and as we were all in the same boat, so to speak, it was not long before
we became quite friendly.
</p>
<p>“ ‘As the days went by we often talked about the things over which we passed, and
many a time we wondered what some of them meant.
</p>
<p>“ ‘Very strangely, perhaps, the higher we were taken into the air, the better our
eyesight became; until, like ocean birds, we could see right down into the deepest
deeps of the sea. It was, therefore, not at all difficult for us to pick out all kinds
of things not usually seen from the surface of the water, or even from the top of
a ship’s mast.
</p>
<p>“ ‘One of the first and most alluring sights we thus saw, was a circular bed of coral,
all pink and glowing in the clear still depths of the Pacific Ocean.
</p>
<p>“ ‘Later on, when crossing the Caribbean Sea, we saw enormous masses of coloured sea-weeds
fantastically curling their hands and arms in a never-ending variety of graceful movements.
Almost immediately, there came before our eyes dark old Spanish galleons, stuffed
with stolen gold, sunk by British merchant-ships, or maybe privateers, all their crews
still stark and stiff in the deep unmoving waters. Not far removed was the gallant
little ship in which Sir Richard Grenville and his glorious crew fought, single-handed,
a fleet of Spanish Buccaneers; and, rather than yield, sank beside their guns. There
they were, still resolute of pose in spite of all the years that have gone since then,
and, seemingly, ready as ever to uphold the valour and the honour of the British race.
</p>
<p>“ ‘Anon came other sights and scenes. Southward over Africa we float, peering at the
Kraals, or houses, of African negroes; the patches where they grow their mealies,
and the wide open spaces <span class="pageNum" id="pb102">[<a href="#pb102">102</a>]</span>where their cattle roam. And, heavy now with our growing weight, the cloud just skims
over the tall tops of a far-flung forest, when, full in view upon a great square of
cleared land, we see a mighty host of stalwart Zulus being marshalled by their Chief
in readiness for war. Without the slightest warning, they give vent to a most terrifying
shout. Instantly a vast number of our fellow-travellers, thoroughly startled, fall
from the cloud to the ground, and, as it suddenly rises again, we see them running
as hard as they can for the creeks and the river not far away.
</p>
<p>“ ‘Turning northward, for days and days we seemed to do nothing but drift and drift,
the weather all the time becoming warmer and warmer. Then, just as if an intervening
screen had been pulled suddenly and swiftly away, there below us lay the great Desert
of Sahara. Far, far down, a thin stream of camels, heavily laden, were wending their
way in the peculiar, tortuous, twisting fashion which is common to them. Upon the
camels’ backs were gaily-coloured coverings fringed and tasseled with red and gold.
On certain of the camels, in a kind of tent, rode a number of dark-eyed ladies, dressed
in the most gorgeous silks and satins, their faces partly veiled, their little feet
encased in dainty slippers, but always their flashing teeth and shining eyes to show
that they were happy.
</p>
<p>“ ‘All at once the scene is changed. A broad line of swiftly-moving horses comes,
as it were, from nowhere—grey horses, whose arching necks, slim legs, and small round
feet, show them to be Arab thoroughbreds. Astride these horses there are dark-browed
men in cloak-like white burnooses, racing forward in such a way that it is plainly
their intention to surround, and, maybe, murder, those connected with the camels.
</p>
<p>“ ‘But not without a struggle will they be permitted to do as they please, for as
soon as they are seen, the camels are drawn into a circle, and the dark-eyed ladies
set within its very centre. Inside the ring, behind their animals, who have been told
to lie down, are crouched the grim, alert, and silent merchants. In their hands are
their rifles, ready loaded. Everything is death-like in its stillness. Even the thudding
of the horses’ hoofs, at all times faint upon the sand, is, by the gentle breeze blown
in the opposite direction.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb103">[<a href="#pb103">103</a>]</span></p>
<p>“ ‘Suddenly there comes a yell from the charging horsemen, and, at the very same instant,
a flash of guns from the merchants. But, alas! in less time than it takes to describe
it, the horsemen are victorious, the merchants are dead or captive, the dark-eyed
ladies tied with silken cords, and the whole train—camels, horses and human beings—set
in motion towards the desert City, wherein those of the merchants who are still alive
will be turned into slaves, their goods and camels sold to the highest bidders, and
their ladies taken into the harems of the Arabs rich enough to buy them.
</p>
<p>“ ‘Northward still we go, until Mount Vesuvius is reached. Oh, what a smoke and heat!
I nearly dropped with suffocation! Indeed, I should have fallen straight into the
great red yawning crater, with its awful fires, had it not been for the soft but strong
hold by which the cloud upheld me. Never again do I want to see that burning place.
The very memory of it, even now, causes me to tremble.…
</p>
<p>“ ‘Then, not far from Mount Vesuvius it seemed, we barely succeeded in passing over
such gigantic mountains that their tops are forever covered in snow—white, cold and
unutterably still. Yet, even as we gazed, dumb-struck with the wonder of it all, there
came the sun’s great rays, and, magically, gloriously, turned the snow to gold—to
gleaming gold, mountains of gold!
</p>
<p>“ ‘Southward and Eastward then we went! Over the burning plains of India, past the
Taj Mahal, that mighty monument to woman’s love and virtue, and to the memory of a
great Prince; southward to Ceylon, set within the circling seas, and then, rapidly
over the ocean back to Australia, where, glad to see and smell the Eucalypts again,
down I fell to do them service!
</p>
<p>“ ‘As to why I fall, it is because that is the only way in which I can do my share
of the things that must be done. My chief duty is to nurture and refresh everything
that grows; and as that can best be accomplished by falling on or about them, therefore
that is the thing I do.’ ”
</p>
<p>When this story was completed, there suddenly broke out such a hum of conversation
that it was quite a little time before the Prince <span class="pageNum" id="pb104">[<a href="#pb104">104</a>]</span>was able to announce that, by special request, the Official Recorder had consented
to give a contribution towards the evening’s entertainment.

<h2 class="main">THE DOOR MAT’S STORY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Once upon a time, a long while ago, I met a wandering Scribe who told me how he had
once heard a Door Mat and a Bass Broom talking to each other. Strange as it may seem,
they appear to have made many shrewd observations, and, put into rhyme, this is the
gist of what the Scribe said:—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">This is the tale of the front Door Mat,
</p>
<p class="line">And this is the pith of his learning:
</p>
<p class="line">He who aspires as a brave man should;
</p>
<p class="line">She who desires what a sweet maid would;
</p>
<p class="line">Must, ere they rise in the World’s affairs,
</p>
<p class="line">Learn that the prizes they seek are theirs,
</p>
<p class="line">If they, in the struggle with carks and cares,
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Keep Sweet!
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Clean their feet!
</p>
<p class="line">And leave behind them the grit of the street!
</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">This is the story he told his friend,
</p>
<p class="line">His friend, the Broom—
</p>
<p class="line">The Big, Bass Broom,
</p>
<p class="line">Who never was known to enter a Room,
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">But swept and scrubbed
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Until he was dubbed

<p class="line">The Garden Paths and the Clothes Yard!

<p class="line">This is his narrative, word for word,

<p class="line">Just as he rendered it; overheard

<p class="line">Up near the door, where the Fairy Scribe
</p>
<p class="line">Wrote it all down for his own wee tribe;
</p>
<p class="line">And, so he said, to the Town next day
</p>
<p class="line">Took it to print; but I grieve to say

<p class="line">That not ’till now has it seen the light!
</p>
<p class="line">But, as you know, in the Town’s poor plight,
</p>
<p class="line">Things are o’erlooked both by night and day,

<p class="line">And thus, I learn, went the ‘proofs’ astray!

<p class="line">‘At the big front door I’ve stood for years,

<p class="line">I have seen them gay, and seen them sad,
</p>
<p class="line">I have known some good, and met some bad;
</p>
<p class="line">But from each and all I learned a truth,
</p>
<p class="line">And of this I speak in love and ruth;
</p>
<p class="line">For the thing they taught (which all may learn),
</p>
<p class="line">Is to purchase not before you earn;

<div class="lg">
<p class="line">‘I have seen some come with goods to sell,

<p class="line">For have I not also learned it well?
</p>
<p class="line">And to those who happen to cross my way,
</p>
<p class="line">From the facts I’ve gained, I often say:
</p>
<p class="line">If you want to win in life’s great game,
</p>
<p class="line">It is well to stop when burns the flame!
</p>
<p class="line">For the one who dares with fire to play,

<p class="line">For the Law is this: ’Tis clearly writ—

</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">So these are the words of the Mat and the Broom;

<p class="line">“Attempt not to better the style of your room,

<p class="first">When the “Official Recorder” had finished, the Prince stood up and said that he had
great pleasure in asking the fourth of the “Five Story Tellers” to tell a tale.
</p>
<p>And this is the story told by “Smell”:—

<h2 class="main">CLOVER PERFUME’S STORY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Once upon a time, a long while ago, I was looking for a lost baby Fairy in a field
of well-grown, rich red clover.
</p>
<p>“The day was warm, and the drowsy hum of countless bees suggested to my mind that,
perhaps the object of my search had fallen down, and was somewhere lying asleep beneath
the spreading clover. Very carefully, therefore, I pulled aside many and many a bunch
of sweet smelling blossoms, hoping to discover him.
</p>
<p>“Just as I found him I accidentally plucked a somewhat larger blossom than the rest
from off its long, green stem, and, not exactly thinking of what I was doing, I parted
the petals; and there, in the very heart of the flower, I saw the sweetest little
fellow in creation.
</p>
<p>“In spite of the fact that he had been disturbed in a nap—for he woke up the very
moment I espied him—his face instantly wreathed itself in smiles, and he waved his
tiny hand at me in the friendliest greeting imaginable. Of a truth his whole attitude
and bearing were so pleasant and affable that I was greatly taken with him, and felt
an immediate desire to have him tell me something of his history, and his work. Indeed,
so strongly was my curiosity aroused, that, almost before I was aware of it, I said:
‘Who are you, and what is your story?’
</p>
<p>“And this is what he said in answer to my question:—
</p>
<p>“ ‘My name is Clover Perfume, and I am one of a very numerous family. To tell you
the truth, I have brothers and sisters and all manner of other relatives all over
the world. Everybody knows me,’ he continued, ‘except those who cannot smell, and
they would nearly give their noses to make my acquaintance!’
<span class="pageNum" id="pb109">[<a href="#pb109">109</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Here he laughed so merrily that for the life of me I couldn’t help laughing too,
though what it was all about I really couldn’t say.
</p>
<p>“ ‘But,’ said he, ‘although I am so widely known and, I think, very well liked, I
have never before been asked to tell my story. I have just been accepted as a matter
of course, and nobody has been the least little bit interested to know anything about
my origin or history.’
</p>
<p>“Here he heaved a very great sigh, and the breath that he expelled from his lungs
was so divinely sweet that it filled my senses with delight.
</p>
<p>“Instantly recovering himself, however, he brightly added: ‘Still, I am very, <i>very</i> glad that you have asked me to tell you my story, and if you will listen, it will
be a pleasure to let you hear it from beginning to end.’
</p>
<p>“ ‘Go on!’ said I, encouragingly; ‘you will find in me a very patient listener.’
</p>
<p>“ ‘Well,’ he commenced, ‘as you are probably very well aware, when God first made
man he was nothing more than a lifeless image; he could neither move nor speak! But
having fashioned him so much like Himself, and being pleased with His work, God breathed
into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul! This was the greatest
of all gifts. On no other created Thing was anything like so remarkable and wonderful
a gift bestowed.
</p>
<p>“ ‘But, what you do not know is that, whilst the making of man was in progress, the
trees and flowers were looking on—silent, still, and breathless with amazement and
surprise. Indeed, so astonished were they, so overpowered at the miracle they were
privileged to see, that they temporarily ceased to grow, and might easily have died.
</p>
<p>“ ‘But this was not to be; for, seeing what had happened, God caused them to revive,
and knowing that He had already fixed for them their stations and their modes of life,
out of His great compassion, and because of the awe and reverence with which they
had looked upon His work, said to them: “Behold I give unto you a further gift. Beauty
and symmetry thou hast! In addition, take from Me all those who will, the gift of
sweetness, that ye may forever bear witness to the airs of Heaven and the glory of
your Creator!”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb110">[<a href="#pb110">110</a>]</span></p>
<p>“ ‘So saying, into the soft and balmy air He breathed one glorious breath, which,
spreading and falling, was, in the process, disintegrated or broken up into a myriad
marvellous atoms. These ineffably sweet and fertilising atoms the trees and flowers
immediately and eagerly <i>in-breathed</i>—some more, some less, each according to its mode and manner, but all with rapturous
delight.
</p>
<p>“ ‘And one tiniest atom there was that, falling lower than the rest, fell upon a pale
<span class="corr" id="xd31e1535" title="Source: while">white</span> clover blossom, who, when she drew in the impregnating life-giving breath of the
Almighty, blushed to rosy redness, and in perpetual remembrance of that great occasion,
has ever since retained her beauteous colouring.…
</p>
<p>“ ‘Later on I was born, and, even as I lay in the soft and delicate arms of my roseate
mother, she began to whisper to me little portions of this wondrous story.
</p>
<p>“ ‘As I grew in strength, and my mind acquired a better grasp of things, I finally
got to understand the meaning of it all, and to appreciate to the full how remarkably
lucky I was to have been blessed with so fortunate a mother.
</p>
<p>“ ‘When, at last, she saw that I was fully awake to all these things, she began to
confide in me the set ambition of her life, the dearest wishes of her heart. And those
wishes I am proud and happy to execute, for they not only serve to indicate the loving
and the gracious nature of my mother, but they are in themselves so pleasing that
I have no other aim in life except to carry them out.
</p>
<p>“ ‘As to what they are, you, perhaps, may guess.
</p>
<p>“ ‘In a few words, my mother desired above all other things in the world, that some
portion of the boon which had been so marvellously bestowed upon her, might in turn
be given to all her kith and kin; and as I had been endowed from birth with the peculiar
faculty of being able to transfer to others some small part of the gift of sweetness
she had been enabled to transmit to me, she naturally and properly taught me how to
exercise and use my talent to the utmost of my capacity.
</p>
<p>“ ‘So it is then that, like a bee, I am engaged in flitting from flower to flower
in order to place in the heart of each a tiniest drop of that miraculous God-given
essence which, as you have learned, was intended <span class="pageNum" id="pb111">[<a href="#pb111">111</a>]</span>to be an eternal reminder of the fact, that, like the sweet odours of Heaven, the
perfume of the flowers and trees is of Divine origin.’ ”
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>As soon as the story was over it immediately became apparent that something was about
to take place which was unknown to Prince Waratah, and quite outside the plan that
he had in mind when the evening’s amusement was begun; for, just as he was rising
to intimate what the next item was to be, King Acacia whispered something in his ear,
and he sat down again.
</p>
<p>What had been said to the Prince nobody knew; but as afterwards appeared, it must
have been a request to be permitted to communicate to the guests a most important
piece of information. That this was the case found instant confirmation in the fact
that with a nod to King Eucalyptus, they both rose in their places, and King Acacia,
addressing the assembled company, said:—
</p>
<p>“We have almost come to the end of the evening’s fixture. Before the last item is
called, however, there is a ceremony to be performed which King Eucalyptus and I have
agreed should now take place. We therefore ask the Official Recorder, who has already
been secretly informed of what is to take place, whether he is ready to proceed?”
</p>
<p>And the Official Recorder answered: “Ready, Your Majesties—and at your service!”
</p>
<p>“Then,” said King Acacia, “we have to announce that, in recognition of the almost
miraculous service performed by Prince Waratah in the building of the Fairy City,
and the erection of the glorious Palace in which we are all met, as well as to fittingly
mark this great occasion, it has been decreed and determined that from this day forth
Prince Waratah shall be King Waratah, and Princess Wattle Blossom shall be Queen Wattle
Blossom!”
</p>
<p>This altogether unexpected announcement naturally came as a surprise to everybody,
the Prince included, but when the nature of it was fully grasped, it was followed
by cheer after cheer until the room rang with their reverberations.
</p>
<p>Proceeding again, when silence was restored, King Acacia turned to the Official Recorder
and said:
<span class="pageNum" id="pb112">[<a href="#pb112">112</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Take notice, that we, King Acacia and King Eucalyptus, in pursuance of the powers
conferred upon us all by the Kings of Fairyland, do require you to set down in golden
letters, in the ‘Official Archives,’ the fact that we, this day, in the presence of
his people name the Prince Waratah, King! And in token of his Kingship we here and
now invest him with the symbols of his authority!”
</p>
<p>He then lightly touched King Waratah upon the shoulder to indicate that he was to
stand up, and, as he did so, King Eucalyptus placed about his shoulders a magnificent
carmine coloured robe embroidered with gold, whilst King Acacia placed upon his head
a splendid crown, so fashioned that it was easy to distinguish the design of Eucalyptus
leaves which adorned the band about his brow, and the several sets of blood-red rubies
set in the shape and form of Waratah blooms, which rose therefrom.
</p>
<p>Without an instant’s pause, however, King Eucalyptus then spoke to the Official Recorder
as follows:—
</p>
<p>“Take notice that we, King Eucalyptus and King Acacia, in pursuance of the powers
conferred upon us by all the Kings of Fairyland, do require you to set down in letters
of gold, in the ‘Official Archives,’ the fact that we this day, in the presence of
her Lord and of his people, name the Princess Wattle Blossom, Queen! And in token
of her queenly rights, subject to her husband, King Waratah, we invest her with the
symbols of her authority!”
</p>
<p>He then lightly touched the Queen upon the shoulder to indicate that she was to stand
up; and, as she did so, King Acacia placed about her shoulders a violet coloured robe
embroidered with silver, whilst King Eucalyptus placed upon her head a lovely crown,
so fashioned that it was easy to distinguish the design of wattle leaves which adorned
the band about her brow, and the several sets of yellow topazes, set in the shape
and form of sprays of wattle blossom, which rose therefrom.
</p>
<p>Thus were both proclaimed and crowned, and the Official Recorder, in accordance with
his duty, closed the ceremony by saying:
</p>
<div class="figure p113width"><img src="images/p113.png" alt="“King Acacia placed upon his head a splendid crown.”" width="607" height="720"><p class="figureHead">“King Acacia placed upon his head a splendid crown.”</p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>“Take notice, that I have this day officially recorded in letters of gold, in the
Official Archives, the proclaiming and the crowning of <span class="pageNum" id="pb115">[<a href="#pb115">115</a>]</span>King Waratah and Queen Wattle Blossom! So be it! Praise be to God!”
</p>
<p>Led by the Band, the whole company then joined in singing—
</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<h4>THE FAIRIES’ NATIONAL ANTHEM.</h4>
<p class="line">Praise to God, the King of Kings,
</p>
<p class="line">Lord of all created things!
</p>
<p class="line">Prince of Love, and Master Mind,
</p>
<p class="line">Still direct us, lest we find
</p>
<p class="line">That for lack of Thine assistance
</p>
<p class="line">Evil meet with scant resistance.
</p>
<p class="line">That in service we, to Thee,
</p>
<p class="line">May Thy gracious kindness bring
</p>
<p class="line">Back in splendid blossoming!

<p class="line">Shelter, Lord, our noble King,
</p>
<p class="line">Safely underneath Thy wing.
</p>
<p class="line">Grant him health, and strength, and skill,
</p>
<p class="line">Aye to do Thy Sovereign Will!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">When the last notes of the anthem had died away, at a sign from King Waratah everybody
except himself sat down.
</p>
<p>Raising his right hand straight above his head, forefinger pointing to the Heavens,
he took the Fairy oath of allegiance as follows: “I, King Waratah, in the presence
of the Official Recorder, and of you all, do solemnly and sincerely undertake that,
to the best of my ability and strength, I will justly and truly administer the affairs
of my Kingdom. So help me God!” To which everybody added: “So be it!” as the King
resumed his seat.
</p>
<p>A moment later he smilingly said: “To bring this glorious evening’s pleasures to a
close, I will now call upon the fifth of ‘The Five Story Tellers’ to tell us a tale.”
</p>
<p>In response “Hearing” immediately stood forth, and this is what he said:—
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="ch12" class="div1 chapter"><span class="pageNum">[<a href="#xd31e283">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">MUSIC’S STORY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Once upon a time, a long while ago, I was standing on the rounded shore of the world,
gazing into space. As I stood there, lost <span class="pageNum" id="pb116">[<a href="#pb116">116</a>]</span>in thought, my attention was eventually called to a long, slow succession of sounds
like sighs, infinitely sad, but inexpressibly sweet.
</p>
<p>“Whilst I was wondering what these sounds might mean, and from whence they came, at
my feet I suddenly perceived a very extraordinary-looking little person, who appeared
to be all head and no body. He was looking up at me with such a wistful expression
on his face that I felt impelled to ask him, ‘Who are you, and what is your Story?’
And by way of answer, in a very slow and somewhat hesitating way, this is what he
said:—
</p>
<p>“ ‘My name is Music, though my parents call me Breve. For untold ages I have lived
upon the outer edge of the earth with my father, Harmony, and my mother, Concord.
Both my parents have quite an exalted opinion of me; but so far I have not come up
to their expectations. I am very sorry that this should be the case, for nothing would
please me better than to justify their hopes.
</p>
<p>“ ‘The truth is, however, that they are so wrapped up in each other and their mutual
affairs, that they will not listen to what I have to say, and so I make no progress.
I am but a single sound sighing in a wilderness! If by chance I could persuade them,
or, for that matter, anyone else, to do what I know in my mind is the right thing
to be done, I am certain I should be a success. I know, though they do not, that my
head is as full of dainty melodies as a pomegranate is full of pretty seeds, and that
if only my poor tongue-tied condition were remedied, so that I might use that organ
as it should be used, I could release an Octave, eight little fellows who beneath
my tongue are now held captive; but who, if they were only free, are possessed of
such astounding and never-ending ability, as to be able to produce a succession of
the most musical notes, the like of which have never before been heard.’
</p>
<p>“Here he sighed most mightily, and then it was that I saw he rested in the opening
of a shell that is called a ‘conch.’
</p>
<p>“ ‘But,’ said I, ‘how am I to loose your tongue? I am no surgeon, neither have I a
knife or other cutting instrument wherewith to perform the operation. Besides, would
you not die if such an unpractised hand as mine attempted so delicate a task?’
<span class="pageNum" id="pb117">[<a href="#pb117">117</a>]</span></p>
<p>“ ‘Not at all!’ he replied, in his soft, slow tone; ‘I should certainly die away just
as an echo does when fleeing into space; but it really would not hurt me, I assure
you!’
</p>
<p>“Still feeling very puzzled, however, I sought for further information, and so said
to him, ‘But where and how did you become possessed of all these sweet-sounding notes
which you claim your Octave can produce with such never-ending brilliance and variety?
And further, supposing I were willing to assist you in the direction you desire, having
no knife, as I told you before, is there any other way in which I could safely render
you the service that you seek?’
</p>
<p>“Instantly he brightened, and, speaking as fast as his poor tongue-tied condition
would permit, this is what he replied:
</p>
<p>“ ‘These notes that I am simply yearning to release I have carefully gathered together
over millions of years! They have come to me from the Ocean and the Breeze, and, as
they came, I classified and arranged them. Over me, throughout those infinite ages,
the tumbling seas have tossed and the careless winds have blown! But always, whenever
a new note I heard, I promptly seized upon it and stored it with the rest, and as
it is tens of thousands of years since last I added to my collection, I am now fully
satisfied that there are no fresh notes to be obtained.
</p>
<p>“ ‘As to the way in which you can assist me, please hold me up to face the wind, or,
better still, blow upon me strongly with your breath, and all will be well.’
</p>
<p>“So, obedient to his desire, I picked him up in my two hands, and holding him firmly,
blew sharply and strongly upon him with my breath, and, true enough, just as he had
predicted, out came eight little fellows who called themselves ‘Semi-Breves,’ dancing
and jumping about on my hands in the utmost glee!
</p>
<p>“All at once they started singing, ‘Blow again! Blow again!’ and so amused was I with
their caperings and cries that I blew upon them just as I had blown upon Breve, whom
I thereupon let fall.
</p>
<p>“In the flash of an eye my hands filled to overflowing with any number of other little
fellows, who called themselves ‘Minims,’ ‘Crotchets,’ ‘Quavers,’ and ‘Semi-Quavers,’
and I know not what beside. And they laughed such pretty rippling laughter that I
felt <span class="pageNum" id="pb118">[<a href="#pb118">118</a>]</span>constrained to join them. Yet, almost before I could utter a sound, some of them popped
into my mouth, and to my utter astonishment, I found my hard, dry laughter had become
almost as musical as their own.
</p>
<p>“Whilst still more or less amazed at this delightful discovery, a skylark and a nightingale,
attracted by the sweet sounds, came up to listen to what was taking place. ‘Here,’
said I, ‘take some of these for yourselves!’ and I threw to each of them a few of
the notes just as they started to speak. Both were nearly choked as the notes went
flying down their throats, but when they next essayed to speak they sang instead,
and the music in their voices was of such a quality as to leave the listeners spellbound
with delight.
</p>
<p>“These extraordinary happenings gave me a great idea. Calling to my aid the idling
Winds, I said to them, ‘Take from me these glorious notes; spread them far and wide;
leaving some where’er you sink to rest, and giving some to all who care to take them.
Be swift, and see to it that your task is well performed!’
</p>
<p>“Happily the winds were willing to obey my orders; and so, to the uttermost ends of
the Universe there was taken a measure of Music’s notes. And to every class and kind
of living thing was offered a share. A very few refused the munificent gift, and so
spend their lives in stony silence.
</p>
<p>“But the great majority accepted, some, the singers, to improve their voices; others,
the players upon instruments, to add to the deftness of their fingers and the delicacy
of their touch; others, again, such as the Nightingale, the Bul-bul, and the Skylark,
to fill the night or morning with their glorious mother melodies, to the great delight
of all who pause to hear!”
</p>
<p>Thus ended the Story, and so was brought to a happy conclusion the ceremonies and
the entertainments connected with the marriage festivities.
</p>
<p>The Band then struck up the Fairies’ National Anthem, and as all stood up whilst King
Waratah and Queen Wattle Blossom passed slowly and smilingly down the room, there
began for the Royal couple such a wonderful career of love and happiness that even
to this day it is the pride and joy of Austral Fairyland!

<h2 class="main">THE MOON’S GARDEN PARTY</h2>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">In the days before to-day,
</p>
<p class="line">Ere the Stars were made to stay
</p>
<p class="line">In the places where, since then, they shed their light!
</p>
<p class="line">They, the Children of the Sky,
</p>
<p class="line">Full of fun, but coy and shy,
</p>
<p class="line">To the Moon, their mother, came one happy summer night!
</p>
<p class="line">Came they seeking right disposal
</p>
<p class="line">Of a sweet but strange proposal;
</p>
<p class="line">Which was, that to Earth they should be taken,
</p>
<p class="line">And upon its sward so green,
</p>
<p class="line">Meet the creatures they had seen
</p>
<p class="line">The Sun, with his spears, each morning waken!
</p>
<p class="line">Thus it was, their eyes alight,
</p>
<p class="line">Round her knees they clustered tight,—
</p>
<p class="line">Clamant for the new delight!
</p>
<p class="line">And the Moon, Dear Mother Moon!
</p>
<p class="line">Smilingly inclined her head,
</p>
<p class="line">And in whispers softly said:
</p>
<p class="line">“We shall go there very soon, very soon!”
</p>
<p class="line">So, without a shred of doubt,
</p>
<p class="line">It was thus it came about
</p>
<p class="line">That Her Majesty, the Moon,
</p>
<p class="line">In her silver gown and shoon,
</p>
<p class="line">Held a Revel one high noon
</p>
<p class="line">In a large and lovely garden with a Lawn!
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">And such a Lawn!
<span class="pageNum" id="pb122">[<a href="#pb122">122</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">It was wide and smooth and ordered,
</p>
<p class="line">And with shady trees ’twas bordered
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">All around!
</p>
<p class="line">In the centre, there were beds,
</p>
<p class="line">Full of plants; all greens and reds,
</p>
<p class="line">And a lake that mirrored them till dawn!
</p>
<p class="line">And about the lake so fair
</p>
<p class="line">There was wavy maiden-hair
</p>
<p class="line">That from out its rocky edges shyly grew!
</p>
<p class="line">But, above the mignonette,
</p>
<p class="line">Where the other blossoms met,
</p>
<p class="line">There were whisperings of apprehensions new;
</p>
<p class="line">And the flowers, bathed in light,
</p>
<p class="line">Seemed to tremble, as with fright,
</p>
<p class="line">When the straying Autumn breezes gently blew!
</p>
<p class="line">For the fingers of the wind
</p>
<p class="line">Caught them playfully behind,
</p>
<p class="line">And so doing, shook their fragrance on the air!
</p>
<p class="line">Threw it broadcast on the undulating air!
</p>
<p class="line">Out beyond the garden fences,
</p>
<p class="line">Through the paddocks, there commences
</p>
<p class="line">The unbroken bushland prime;
</p>
<p class="line">In its sheltering recesses
</p>
<p class="line">Nature nurtures and caresses
</p>
<p class="line">All that’s native to this clime!
</p>
<p class="line">There, man’s ruthless usurpation
</p>
<p class="line">Stops, and peaceful occupation
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Is conceded,
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Unimpeded,
</p>
<p class="line">To all who make it their abode or habitation!
</p>
<p class="line">Yet this spot of earth primeval,
</p>
<p class="line">With its denizens coeval,
</p>
<p class="line">Does not always peace contain;
</p>
<p class="line">And the hushed and restful stillness
</p>
<p class="line">Oft is broken by the shrillness
</p>
<p class="line">Of some cry of fear or pain!
<span class="pageNum" id="pb123">[<a href="#pb123">123</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">Goshawks grey, or red, or white,
</p>
<p class="line">And the tense black-shouldered kite,
</p>
<p class="line">Soar and strike the livelong day!
</p>
<p class="line">And at night the marbled owl,
</p>
<p class="line">Swiftest of night’s hunting fowl,
</p>
<p class="line">Swoops upon its startled prey!
</p>
<p class="line">Still, not all is black disaster;
</p>
<p class="line">Death is fleet, but life is faster,
</p>
<p class="line">And its numbers aye o’ermaster
</p>
<p class="line">Death’s invading arms!
</p>
<p class="line">O’er a gum-tree, lightning-blasted,—
</p>
<p class="line">(Where once honey-bees repasted!)
</p>
<p class="line">See the Forest Queen her creamy mantle throw;
</p>
<p class="line">Or upon a bank of rubble
</p>
<p class="line">Barely clothed with ferny stubble,
</p>
<p class="line">Watch the purple smilax dainty blossoms blow!
</p>
<p class="line">Or again, where “bottle brushes,”
</p>
<p class="line">Peopled are by singing thrushes,—
</p>
<p class="line">From whose throats a chorus rushes,
</p>
<p class="line"><i>Note the Forest’s charms!</i>
</p>
<p class="line">. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
</p>
<p class="line">Now within the garden grand
</p>
<p class="line">A great Summerhouse did stand;
</p>
<p class="line">And its doors were very wide and extra high;
</p>
<p class="line">For within it, tree-ferns tall,
</p>
<p class="line">Spread their fronds from wall to wall,
</p>
<p class="line">And so thickly, that they quite shut out the sky.
</p>
<p class="line">This, the stars banked up with flowers—
</p>
<p class="line">Culled from all the aerial bowers
</p>
<p class="line">That behind the clouds are hid from mortal sight!
</p>
<p class="line">And they then with loving care
</p>
<p class="line">Decked the whole with colours rare,
</p>
<p class="line">Brought to beauty by their own resplendent light!
</p>
<p class="line">Viands, too, they brought and spread
</p>
<p class="line">On a table that with bread
</p>
<p class="line">And all delicatest dainties was agleam!
<span class="pageNum" id="pb124">[<a href="#pb124">124</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">This they did, that guests to leave,
</p>
<p class="line">Might, ere going, each receive
</p>
<p class="line">From the hostess Queen a gift on which to dream!
</p>
<p class="line">In the meantime, there was sent
</p>
<p class="line">Through the garden’s wide extent,—
</p>
<p class="line">A most kindly note to all who therein delve,
</p>
<p class="line">To attend an evening Fete,
</p>
<p class="line">When the Moon, in robes of State,
</p>
<p class="line">Would receive and entertain them, just at twelve!
</p>
<p class="line">Then excitement grew intense,
</p>
<p class="line">For a problem so immense
</p>
<p class="line">Had not ever met the garden folk before!
</p>
<p class="line">How were they to meet the Queen,
</p>
<p class="line">Who, ere this, had not been seen,
</p>
<p class="line">Save above them, as a Goddess to adore?
</p>
<p class="line">Who among them all should lead?
</p>
<p class="line">What new dresses would they need?
</p>
<p class="line">Would they want an introduction, or just pass
</p>
<p class="line">Like the troops upon parade
</p>
<p class="line">When a demonstration’s made,
</p>
<p class="line">And the King himself reviews them in the mass;
</p>
<p class="line">These, and nicer questions all,
</p>
<p class="line">At a Conference or Call,
</p>
<p class="line">In discussion, were determined and agreed!
</p>
<p class="line">So it fell that at long last,
</p>
<p class="line">All their worries overpast,
</p>
<p class="line">There was nought to do save gather and proceed!
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">But talk about a clatter!
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Speak about a row!
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Why a Black’s Corroboree,
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Or an Indian Pow-Wow
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Are as nothing,
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Simply nothing,
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">To the rattle and the roar
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">That all other sounds defied,—
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">When the guests began to pour
<span class="pageNum" id="pb125">[<a href="#pb125">125</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Through the gate
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">At a rate
</p>
<p class="line">That a shepherd could not state
</p>
<p class="line">If to count them he had tried!
</p>
<p class="line">For, like little Dolly Varden,
</p>
<p class="line">All the dwellers in the garden,
</p>
<p class="line">All the beetles and the other tiny things;
</p>
<p class="line">All the spiders and the aphis,
</p>
<p class="line">With the “Kooka,” and the Mavis,
</p>
<p class="line">Came a-hopping and a-flopping
</p>
<p class="line">On their little legs and wings!
</p>
<p class="line">And the cries that they emitted!
</p>
<p class="line">Made one think that they were fitted
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">For a Zoo,
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Perhaps two!—
</p>
<p class="line">By the way they carried on!
</p>
<p class="line">But to silence all were bidden,
</p>
<p class="line">When from out the cornflowers hidden
</p>
<p class="line">Came a Mantis, with his hands outspread and high;
</p>
<p class="line">And in tones that each could hear,
</p>
<p class="line">Full and round, yet sweet and clear,
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Simply cried:
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">“Stand aside!
</p>
<p class="line">For the Mower and his Lady now draw nigh!”
</p>
<p class="line">Then to places all were hurried;
</p>
<p class="line">Some were late, and so were flurried,
</p>
<p class="line">But the Marshal set them right!
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Marshal Spider!—
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Splendid Rider!—
</p>
<p class="line">Mounted on a Magpie proud;—
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Set to order,
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Quelled disorder,
</p>
<p class="line">Closed the lines and kept the crowd!
</p>
<p class="line">For the stakes, to which the roses
</p>
<p class="line">In the Summer-time were tied;
<span class="pageNum" id="pb126">[<a href="#pb126">126</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">With their sharp and pointed noses
</p>
<p class="line">Stood the carriage drive beside!
</p>
<p class="line">Each was held by some tall froggy,
</p>
<p class="line">Who upon a Falcon black,
</p>
<p class="line">Seemed to wish that it were foggy
</p>
<p class="line">So that he might cool his back!
</p>
<p class="line">But to duty they were bound,
</p>
<p class="line">And not e’en so sweet a sound
</p>
<p class="line">As the lapping of the wavelets on the lake.
</p>
<p class="line">Could have caused them to forsake,
</p>
<p class="line">The especial posts to which they were assigned.
</p>
<p class="line">Theirs the task to guard the Drive,
</p>
<p class="line">So that each one to arrive,
</p>
<p class="line">Might not stray beyond the line
</p>
<p class="line">Of the driveway’s broad incline;
</p>
<p class="line">But would join with all the rest.
</p>
<p class="line">Into proper order pressed,
</p>
<p class="line">In the way the marshal had designed!
</p>
<p class="line">When at length, in silence standing,
</p>
<p class="line">In a voice of power commanding
</p>
<p class="line">Spake the Marshal to the rapt, expectant throng:
</p>
<p class="line">“Let each gallant pair be ready,
</p>
<p class="line">To advance in order, steady,
</p>
<p class="line">When the Mower and his Lady move along;
</p>
<p class="line">For the Mower is our King,
</p>
<p class="line">And behind him we will bring
</p>
<p class="line">To Her Majesty the Moon and to her Court,
</p>
<p class="line">Such a wealth of garden lore
</p>
<p class="line">As may never, never, more
</p>
<p class="line">Be attempted or projected e’en in thought!”
</p>
<p class="line">Scarcely had the Marshal ended
</p>
<p class="line">Ere the Mower’s train extended,
</p>
<p class="line">Fell into its place and moved towards the Lawn!
</p>
<p class="line">First, of course, the Heralds Royal,
</p>
<p class="line">Clothed in all the colours loyal:
</p>
<p class="line">Gaudy Butterflies, with banner-wings outspread.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb127">[<a href="#pb127">127</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">Next the soldier-ants, so sprightly,
</p>
<p class="line">Stepping gaily, straightly, lightly,
</p>
<p class="line">With what seemed a most determined martial tread!
</p>
<p class="line">Followed on the King’s retainers:
</p>
<p class="line">Busy bees in brown and gold;
</p>
<p class="line">Then the bravos and maintainers;
</p>
<p class="line">Hardy beetles, brave and bold.
</p>
<p class="line">After these the Knights and Consuls
</p>
<p class="line">With their Ladies fair and fine:
</p>
<p class="line">All the birds that seek the garden
</p>
<p class="line">When the golden wattles shine!
</p>
<p class="line">In their midst the Mower stately,
</p>
<p class="line">King of all the garden race,—
</p>
<p class="line">And his Queen the Water-sprinkler,
</p>
<p class="line">Tall and slender, full of grace,
</p>
<p class="line">But as shy and quickly startled as a fawn!
</p>
<p class="line">Thus, in order, as directed,—
</p>
<p class="line">None were otherwise detected,
</p>
<p class="line">On they moved to meet the queen!
</p>
<p class="line">On the spacious, trim, and flower-surrounded Lawn!
</p>
<p class="line">And not least among the party
</p>
<p class="line">Were the Mower’s henchmen hearty:
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">All the tools,
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Which he rules
</p>
<p class="line">With a blade both swift and keen!
</p>
<p class="line">Rake and Hoe and Pick and Shovel;
</p>
<p class="line">Fork and Spade and Knife and Can;
</p>
<p class="line">Hammer, Saw, and Sieve and Level;
</p>
<p class="line">Nails and Screws all spick and span;
</p>
<p class="line">Seccateurs and Shears and Spanner;
</p>
<p class="line">Nuts and Bolts and Augers fine;
</p>
<p class="line">Each according to its manner,—
</p>
<p class="line">Rule and Rod and folded line.
</p>
<p class="line">E’en the old green garden barrow,
</p>
<p class="line">On whose forefront perched a sparrow,
</p>
<p class="line">Bobbed along on shaky legs!
<span class="pageNum" id="pb128">[<a href="#pb128">128</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">Then there came the refuse-bin,
</p>
<p class="line">On whose lid of rusty tin
</p>
<p class="line">Danced a group of clothes-pegs!
</p>
<p class="line">After these the yard-broom strode,
</p>
<p class="line">Gruff and grim with seeming ire;
</p>
<p class="line">And from out his dark abode
</p>
<p class="line">Rolled a coil of fencing wire!
</p>
<p class="line">Then emerged the “steps” a-striding,—
</p>
<p class="line">On their top a cat was riding,—
</p>
<p class="line">Tail erect and back all arched!
</p>
<p class="line">Right behind, its white face gleaming,
</p>
<p class="line">From beneath its banner streaming,—
</p>
<p class="line">Bravely on the flagpole marched!
</p>
<p class="line">And, not wishing to be listed
</p>
<p class="line">From a gathering so strange,
</p>
<p class="line">Came the scythe all bent and twisted,
</p>
<p class="line">With the axe, well out of range!
</p>
<p class="line">Other things were there in dozens!
</p>
<p class="line">Little folk the garden cozens,—
</p>
<p class="line">Such as round the Lattice play!
</p>
<p class="line">Snails and Slugs and Red-spot Spiders!
</p>
<p class="line">Thrifty Ants (those rare providers!)
</p>
<p class="line">And the Slaters clothed in grey!
</p>
<p class="line">Churchmen, too: The green-robed Mantis,
</p>
<p class="line">Praying for the lost Atlantis,—
</p>
<p class="line">Or at least they seemed to be!
</p>
<p class="line">Lawyers, clad in black and white:
</p>
<p class="line">Magpies properly bedight,
</p>
<p class="line">And the Lark of Minstrelsy!
</p>
<p class="line">Parrot politicians, too,
</p>
<p class="line">Talking, talking, as they do,—
</p>
<p class="line">Of the scarcity of corn!
</p>
<p class="line">When the spring lambs should be shorn!
</p>
<p class="line">What would happen without rain—
</p>
<p class="line">Would the farmers sow again?
<span class="pageNum" id="pb129">[<a href="#pb129">129</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">But by far the rarest sight,
</p>
<p class="line">Of that wondrous Autumn night,
</p>
<p class="line">Were three lovely kittens white;—
</p>
<p class="line">Who, within a basket sleeping,
</p>
<p class="line">As, ’twas thought, in safest keeping,
</p>
<p class="line">Woke to find that, all undone,
</p>
<p class="line">Their pink ribbons, one by one,
</p>
<p class="line">Had been knotted to their basket
</p>
<p class="line">Tightly as a sailor’s gasket!
</p>
<p class="line">And, as if by Magic brought,
</p>
<p class="line">The basket to a carriage wrought!
</p>
<p class="line">‘Twas all so very, <i>very</i> queer,
</p>
<p class="line">No kitten outside Fairy-land
</p>
<p class="line">Could ever, <i>ever</i> understand
</p>
<p class="line">What made the basket disappear,
</p>
<p class="line">And, in the twinkling of a star,
</p>
<p class="line">Be turned into a basket car!
</p>
<p class="line">But a bright-eyed little mouse,
</p>
<p class="line">Watching from within the house,
</p>
<p class="line">Saw exactly what took place!
</p>
<p class="line">Four brown spiders spun the wheels
</p>
<p class="line">Round about four cotton reels.
</p>
<p class="line">Two red robins wove the hood
</p>
<p class="line">Out of grass and chips of wood.
</p>
<p class="line">Two jays built the driver’s place
</p>
<p class="line">Jutting from the basket’s face.
</p>
<p class="line">Two blue wrens, so spry and neat,
</p>
<p class="line">Fixed behind a “dicky” seat!
</p>
<p class="line">For the lamps, two glow-worms bright,
</p>
<p class="line">Shed their lustre on the night!
</p>
<p class="line">Two woodpeckers made the pole
</p>
<p class="line">From a slender wattle, whole!
</p>
<p class="line">Then, the basket car to draw,
</p>
<p class="line">Four white gulls, in ropes of straw,
</p>
<p class="line">To the carriage firmly tied,
</p>
<p class="line">With each other proudly vied,
<span class="pageNum" id="pb130">[<a href="#pb130">130</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">As they paced along!
</p>
<p class="line">A whip-bird drove the willing team,
</p>
<p class="line">By the star-light’s silver gleam!
</p>
<p class="line">At his side a soldier-ant,
</p>
<p class="line">(Sort of footman-Adjutant!)
</p>
<p class="line">Care-free quite of war’s alarms
</p>
<p class="line">Sat with loosely folded arms!
</p>
<p class="line">Four more soldier-ants beside,
</p>
<p class="line">Lent an air of splendid pride
</p>
<p class="line">To the kittens shy inside!
</p>
<p class="line">Two to ride postillion-wise;
</p>
<p class="line">Two to guard and supervise
</p>
<p class="line">From the seat behind!
</p>
<p class="line">Thus to meet the Queen they fared;
</p>
<p class="line">Nothing wanting, nothing spared
</p>
<p class="line">To please the eye and mind!
</p>
<p class="line">But, before they reached the Queen,
</p>
<p class="line">There was quite a little scene——
</p>
<p class="line">That a temporary stoppage did entail;
</p>
<p class="line">For, with not a warning note,
</p>
<p class="line">From the Rosary remote,—
</p>
<p class="line">Came a sound that made the anxious Marshal quail!
</p>
<p class="line">It was due to some field crickets,
</p>
<p class="line">Who, on coming through the pickets,
</p>
<p class="line">Had been told to be quite ready
</p>
<p class="line">To play something soft and steady
</p>
<p class="line">When Her Majesty the Moon,—
</p>
<p class="line">(Who conferred on them the boon!)
</p>
<p class="line">Should come forth to meet her guests upon the Lawn!
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">But the Band,
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">At its stand,
</p>
<p class="line">Should have waited the command
</p>
<p class="line">To begin the music mystic,
</p>
<p class="line">With its Summer strain artistic,—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb133">[<a href="#pb133">133</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Ere it broke
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">At a stroke
</p>
<p class="line">Into tunings that the sleeping echoes woke!
</p>
<p class="line">So, the worried Marshal spider,
</p>
<p class="line">Sent a swallow-scout outrider
</p>
<p class="line">With most mandatory orders
</p>
<p class="line">To retire behind the borders,
</p>
<p class="line">And await the time propitious
</p>
<p class="line">To begin the strain ambitious,
</p>
<p class="line">Which should tell in martial bars
</p>
<p class="line">That the Queen and Court of stars,
</p>
<p class="line">With attendant satellites,
</p>
<p class="line">And the page boy stellar sprites
</p>
<p class="line">Were in waiting on the Lawn!
</p>
<p class="line">On the smooth and spacious Lawn!
</p>
<p class="line">When the episode was ended,
</p>
<p class="line">And a like mistake forfended,
</p>
<p class="line">Forward went the line extended
</p>
<p class="line">Down the carriage drive!
</p>
<p class="line">Turning, where the beds give entry,
</p>
<p class="line">Past a Robin Redbreast sentry,
</p>
<p class="line">Without haste, as do the gentry,
</p>
<p class="line">On the lawn did they arrive!
</p>
<p class="line">And the Moon that moment walking,
</p>
<p class="line">With her starry daughters, talking,
</p>
<p class="line">From the Summer-house came forth!
</p>
<p class="line">On the instant, came the crashing
</p>
<p class="line">Of the cricket music dashing,
</p>
<p class="line">Swift as pallid lightning flashing
</p>
<p class="line">From the far-off sombre North!
</p>
<p class="line">Stood aside the Heralds then,
</p>
<p class="line">Stepped behind attendants ten,
</p>
<p class="line">And <i>The Mower and his Lady met the Queen</i>!!
<span class="pageNum" id="pb134">[<a href="#pb134">134</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">What a scene!
</p>
<p class="line">Surely ne’er before was seen
</p>
<p class="line">So much majesty serene,
</p>
<p class="line">So much graciousness and light
</p>
<p class="line">As graced the lawn that autumn night!
</p>
<p class="line">For, as each made due obeisance,
</p>
<p class="line">With polite and sweet complaisance,—
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">And passed on;
</p>
<p class="line">Into scattered knots and groups,
</p>
<p class="line">Into merry little troups
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">They fell;
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">And the swell
</p>
<p class="line">Of the mingled conversations,
</p>
<p class="line">And the witty observations;
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">The soft requests
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">And whispered jests,
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">With the laughter
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">That came after,
</p>
<p class="line">To the Queen and all her Court was music rare!
</p>
<p class="line">And the supper fine that followed!
</p>
<p class="line">Oh! what quantities they swallowed
</p>
<p class="line">Of the dainties and the delicacies rare!
</p>
<p class="line">Black ants’ milk and box-tree honey;
</p>
<p class="line">Manna flakes, the shapes of money;
</p>
<p class="line">All the richest kinds of berries,
</p>
<p class="line">Currants, bush-grapes and wild cherries!
</p>
<p class="line">Grains and seeds and sugar-beet
</p>
<p class="line">Such as field birds love to eat!
</p>
<p class="line">Dew, in cups the gum-trees make
</p>
<p class="line">For their lovely blossoms sake.
</p>
<p class="line">These and other things galore
</p>
<p class="line">That the ants and spiders store!
</p>
<p class="line">Ev’ry sort of tasty dish
</p>
<p class="line">Such fastidious folk could wish!
<span class="pageNum" id="pb135">[<a href="#pb135">135</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">Ne’er before was served such fare;
</p>
<p class="line">Full and plenty and to spare!
</p>
<p class="line">Supper over, oh, what fun,
</p>
<p class="line">Was upon the lawn begun!
</p>
<p class="line">Dances, jigs, and turkey-trots
</p>
<p class="line">Round about forget-me-nots,—
</p>
<p class="line">Whose sweet eyes of tender blue
</p>
<p class="line">With amazement changed their hue,
</p>
<p class="line">When a hammer and a spanner
</p>
<p class="line">Underneath the Queen’s own banner,
</p>
<p class="line">In a rather awkward manner
</p>
<p class="line">Danced a sort of highland fling!
</p>
<p class="line">And a lanky Adjutant,—
</p>
<p class="line">With the red-legged Crane, his aunt,
</p>
<p class="line">Winked his eye, and said, “I can’t
</p>
<p class="line">Say I like this kind of thing!”
</p>
<p class="line">But the Augers straight and strong,
</p>
<p class="line">With their own peculiar song
</p>
<p class="line">Drowned his voice their chords among,—
</p>
<p class="line">As they sang:
</p>
<p class="line">“Come along! Oh, come along!
</p>
<p class="line">Join the happy gladsome throng!
</p>
<p class="line">Games that everyone can play;
</p>
<p class="line">Now’s your chance, so come away!”
</p>
<p class="line">Ring-a-rosy! Twos and threes—
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Which the bees
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">‘Mid the trees,
</p>
<p class="line">Played with such consummate ease,
</p>
<p class="line">That the Ladybirds they chased
</p>
<p class="line">Tripped and stumbled as they raced,
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Quite outpaced
</p>
<p class="line">By those honey-hunter bees!
</p>
<p class="line">And the sly and subtle chaffing
</p>
<p class="line">Of the Lovers, who, since quaffing
<span class="pageNum" id="pb136">[<a href="#pb136">136</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">Each the other’s health,
</p>
<p class="line">Had by stealth,
</p>
<p class="line">Sought out places where they might
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Woo delight,
</p>
<p class="line">Free from all the tauntings light
</p>
<p class="line">Of the Merry-makers bright!
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">But, of course,
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">No resource
</p>
<p class="line">Of the sweethearts, could perforce
</p>
<p class="line">Any sort of quietude enforce.
</p>
<p class="line">So they had to just submit
</p>
<p class="line">To the things that stung or hit
</p>
<p class="line">As do lovers everywhere!
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Here and there
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Amid the crowd
</p>
<p class="line">Could be seen the elegant or proud;
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Whilst some, alas,
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">(But let that pass,)
</p>
<p class="line">Were what is known as “loud.”
</p>
<p class="line">The Rake and Hoe, a wicked pair:
</p>
<p class="line">Knight bachelors are they,
</p>
<p class="line">With easy style, true debonair,
</p>
<p class="line">Went strolling ‘mid the ladies fair,
</p>
<p class="line">The gayest of the gay!
</p>
<p class="line">The Spade went prinking round the lawn,
</p>
<p class="line">Miss Shears was on his arm!
</p>
<p class="line">The Hay-fork pitched about till dawn
</p>
<p class="line">Forgetful of the Farm!
</p>
<p class="line">The Fern-tubs frowned upon the scene,
</p>
<p class="line">The Lattice glared its grief;
</p>
<p class="line">The Bulbs, in pots, though quite serene,
</p>
<p class="line">Displayed a sad belief
</p>
<p class="line">That all this freakish capering
</p>
<p class="line">Must bring its own relief!
</p>
<p class="line xd31e521">And so it chanced!
<span class="pageNum" id="pb137">[<a href="#pb137">137</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">For, with scarce a warning sound,
</p>
<p class="line">Straightly stepping o’er the ground
</p>
<p class="line">Where the fence was broken, found,
</p>
<p class="line">Came the bush-folk forth to greet the Queen!
</p>
<p class="line">From the Forest they came ranging,
</p>
<p class="line">All in order, never changing,
</p>
<p class="line">In a stream across the paddocks green!
</p>
<p class="line">At their head, twelve Ibis slender,
</p>
<p class="line">Hid from view a kind of Tender
</p>
<p class="line">Borne upon the backs of Iguanas strong!
</p>
<p class="line">This, first strewn with sweet wild clover,
</p>
<p class="line">Was with bush flowers covered over;
</p>
<p class="line">One fair bloom for ev’ry member of the throng!
</p>
<p class="line">These, as Tribute was intended
</p>
<p class="line">For the Queen Moon great and splendid,
</p>
<p class="line">Whom to honour and to serve
</p>
<p class="line">Without question or reserve
</p>
<p class="line">Was a duty that they loved to pay!
</p>
<p class="line">And their sacred emblem-flowers,
</p>
<p class="line">Choicest of the Forest dowers,—
</p>
<p class="line">Were their gracious Queen to show,
</p>
<p class="line">That among her folk below,
</p>
<p class="line">Nothing could their true allegiance sway!
</p>
<p class="line">Thus enhanced,
</p>
<p class="line">Through the garden they advanced
</p>
<p class="line">Making for the Lawn!
</p>
<p class="line">On they came!
</p>
<p class="line">The Emus stately,
</p>
<p class="line">Proudly, quietly, sedately;
</p>
<p class="line">Followed by the Herons fine!
</p>
<p class="line">Wombats, Wallabys and Dingoes;
</p>
<p class="line">Grey Companion-Flamingoes;—
</p>
<p class="line">‘Keets and Lories line on line!
</p>
<p class="line">Woolly Bears and ‘Possums grey;
</p>
<p class="line">Singing birds and birds of prey;
<span class="pageNum" id="pb138">[<a href="#pb138">138</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">Platypuses; blue-tongued Lizards;
</p>
<p class="line">Mallee Hens, and Bower-Bird wizards,—
</p>
<p class="line">Hiding all they find away!
</p>
<p class="line">Cockatoos, white, black and pink;
</p>
<p class="line">Kestrels, Kites and Shrikes and Bats;
</p>
<p class="line">Flying Foxes; Native Cats;
</p>
<p class="line">Plovers from the Marsh’s brink!
</p>
<p class="line">Kangaroos, like tall men walking;
</p>
<p class="line"><span class="corr" id="xd31e2298" title="Source: Cassowarys">Cassowaries</span> gravely stalking;
</p>
<p class="line">Falcons black, and Wedge-tailed Eagles,—
</p>
<p class="line">Strongest of the feathered beagles!
</p>
<p class="line">And the Egrets all too rare!
</p>
<p class="line">Black-necked Storks with wings so spacious;
</p>
<p class="line">Lyre-birds beautiful and gracious,
</p>
<p class="line">And the Magpie Lark so spare!
</p>
<p class="line">Honeyeaters, Red-capped Robins;
</p>
<p class="line">(In and out like fiery bobbins!)
</p>
<p class="line">Wrens of ev’ry sort and hue,
</p>
<p class="line">And the great Kingfisher blue!
</p>
<p class="line">Whipbirds, Rails and Orioles;
</p>
<p class="line">Bronzewing Pigeons; Pratincoles;
</p>
<p class="line">Every Austral bird of note,
</p>
<p class="line">From the Owl to Pardalote!
</p>
<p class="line">Soarers, perchers, coursers, waders,
</p>
<p class="line">Like an army of invaders,
</p>
<p class="line">On they came towards the Lawn!
</p>
<p class="line">The spacious, cool, green Lawn!
</p>
<p class="line">Presently, as they drew nearer,
</p>
<p class="line">Forms and faces growing clearer;
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Silence fell,
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Like a spell,
</p>
<p class="line">On the guests who just before
</p>
<p class="line">Had not dreamed there was in store,
</p>
<p class="line">A sight so passing strange!
<span class="pageNum" id="pb139">[<a href="#pb139">139</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">E’en the Queen herself, ’twas plain,
</p>
<p class="line">Looked for someone to explain,
</p>
<p class="line">At and on whose word they came!
</p>
<p class="line">But, as soon as on the Lawn
</p>
<p class="line">The new arrivals all were drawn;
</p>
<p class="line">Forward stepped a Cockatoo,
</p>
<p class="line">In his milk-white plumage new;
</p>
<p class="line">And in accents somewhat high,
</p>
<p class="line">Said they thus had ventured nigh,
</p>
<p class="line">That they might their homage yield,
</p>
<p class="line">To their Sovereign and their Shield,
</p>
<p class="line">For whose sake they’d gladly die.
</p>
<p class="line">Then, without undue premise,
</p>
<p class="line">Like a statesman, very wise,—
</p>
<p class="line">Craved the Queen’s most sweet permission,
</p>
<p class="line">To present, without omission,
</p>
<p class="line">All the several little groups
</p>
<p class="line">That in eager anxious troupes
</p>
<p class="line">Waited on her word!
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">And the Queen,
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">It was seen,
</p>
<p class="line">Smiled so gracious a consent,
</p>
<p class="line">That they all, with one intent,
</p>
<p class="line">As in passing, down they bent,
</p>
<p class="line">Flung their flowers about her feet!
</p>
<p class="line">Ringed her round with posies sweet!
</p>
<p class="line">This fair ceremony ended,
</p>
<p class="line">Everyone who there attended,
</p>
<p class="line">As their way about they wended,
</p>
<p class="line">Met and fraternised!
</p>
<p class="line">Filling out the pleasures light
</p>
<p class="line">Of that most historic night!
</p>
<p class="line">Thus, as in a lover’s passion,
</p>
<p class="line">Passed the time in wondrous fashion;
<span class="pageNum" id="pb140">[<a href="#pb140">140</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">Full of such excitements new,
</p>
<p class="line">That the moments simply flew,—
</p>
<p class="line">On, and on, towards the dawn!
</p>
<p class="line">Then,
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Ere the sun
</p>
<p class="line xd31e1221">Had begun
</p>
<p class="line">To ope his golden portals,—
</p>
<p class="line">Or awake were sleepy mortals;
</p>
<p class="line">All by common impulse moved,
</p>
<p class="line">Turned towards the Queen they loved,
</p>
<p class="line">And bending low, gave salutation!
</p>
<p class="line">Yet, ere moving finally away,
</p>
<p class="line">“Farewell! A fair farewell!” to each they say;
</p>
<p class="line">Resolved through work or play,
</p>
<p class="line">To keep that night of nights,
</p>
<p class="line">Like some green growing thing,
</p>
<p class="line">The symbol of Eternal Spring,
</p>
<p class="line">In sweet and fondest memory for aye!
</p>
<p class="line">And the Moon and starry Court,
</p>
<p class="line">That the wonderment had wrought,
</p>
<p class="line">Faded slowly out of sight
</p>
<p class="line">In a blaze of newer light;
</p>
<p class="line">So strong and bright
</p>
<p class="line">That it swept away the night,
</p>
<p class="line">And to the wakened World a new Day brought!</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
